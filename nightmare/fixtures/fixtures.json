STORY\n\nOur starting model\nIn 2010, HURIDOCS partnered with IHRDA to develop The Case Law Analyser (CLA)\n(http://caselaw.ihrda.org), allowing open access to human rights case law from all African regional bodies,\nincluding the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, African Committee of Experts on the\nRights and Welfare of the Child, the African Court, the East African Court of Justice (EACJ), the ECOWAS\nCommunity Court of Justice, and SADCT.\n\nScaling success, sustainably\nThe tool was a success, and we were approached by several NGOs to develop something similar catered\nto their needs.\n\n\fInstead of redeveloping CLA software for each partner, we’ve tried another approach: empower NGOs and\norganizations to create and share their own libraries on-demand. Because of our track record with\ninnovation, UwaziDocs has been generously supported by the MacArthur Foundation\n(https://www.macfound.org/).\nBut many people and organizations are interested to share their knowledge, not just our partners. So that’s\nwhy we’ve made UwaziDocs open source and available to everyone online, on any device. We’re taking\nopen source principles and transparency to heart by sharing every part of the development we can on our\nRoadmap (/roadmap/).\n\n\fOur foundation: relationships and\nfeedback\nThe inception workshop: identifying the need\n\nBefore starting development, we set out to nd out what potential users would nd most valuable. At an\nevent in September 2015 (Sponsored by the PIL Network, Kenya), we invited 21 organizations to learn\nabout their work and goals, including what kinds of documents they want to share, what format those\ndocuments are in, what they’re already sharing, and how they’re sharing it.\nWhat we learned\n\nIt wasn’t a surprise, but various document types, formats, and platforms were used among the pilot\nparticipants and even within singular organizations. We heard about hefty challenges to publish\ndocuments: a lack of cohesive systems and structures, scattered and unaccounted for information, and\nthe nuanced burdens of archaic platforms. Participants agreed: there was no easy way to publish large\ndocument collections. We had found our challenge.\n\n\fOur challenge: turn clutter into clarity\nNext, we asked what their ideal platform for publishing and sharing large collections of documents would\nbe like.

My hero\nwould go from being an unpleasant,\nintroverted jerk to the most cosmic being in\nthe universe, and I would tie it into my thennew interest in astrology. After his\nearthbound beginning, his mind would be\nopened step by step, with a fast-action story\non Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war\nstory on Mars, and so on out to the edge of\nthe solar system, and then beyond.\n\nFlight\nAbility to travel through space\n\nBut – after his earthbound beginning, where\nI established him as an unpleasant,\nintroverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one\never saw what he was to become.[1]\nStar-Lord continued to appear in Marvel Preview, with writer Chris Claremont revamping the character and\nusing science ﬁction adventure stories like the Heinlein juveniles for inspiration.[2] Heinlein's lawyers\nthreatened legal action over the cover to Marvel Preview #11, which featured a blurb that described the content\nas \"a novel-length science ﬁction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein\", leading to the issue being\npulled and reprinted.[3] The story in #11 was the ﬁrst teaming of the celebrated X-Men creative trio of writer\nChris Claremont, penciller John Byrne, and inker Terry Austin. Star-Lord made sporadic appearances over the\nnext few years in the titles Marvel Super Special,[4] Marvel Spotlight,[5][6][7] and Marvel Premiere.[8][9] In\nFebruary 1982, a color reprint of the black-and-white Starlord story from Marvel Preview #11 was published\nwith a new framing sequence by Claremont and artist Michael Golden.[10][11]\nThe character returned in Thanos #8–12 (May–Sept. 2004) and Annihilation #1-6 (2006). The following year,\nhe received a four issue eponymous title (Annihilation: Conquest – Star-Lord) leading into the \"Annihilation:\nConquest\" crossover storyline, in which he played a central role. Spinning out of \"Annihilation: Conquest\", a\nsecond volume of Guardians of the Galaxy featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by\nStar-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run. Plot lines from that series were concluded in the The\nThanos Imperative mini-series.\nAfter Star-Lord's introduction to Earth-616 in 2004, the appearances of \"classic\" Star-Lord have been ofﬁcially\ndesignated as occurring in Earth-791 due to continuity issues.[12]\nStar-Lord returned, along with other members of the Guardians, in Avengers Assemble #4-8 (June–Oct. 2012).\nHe stars in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, a part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch.[13]\nIn July 2014, Star-Lord received his own ongoing series, Legendary Star-Lord. The character was also given a\nnew costume, matching that seen in the Marvel Studios ﬁlm Guardians of the Galaxy [14]\nHis solo series and Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 ended as Marvel began its \"Secret Wars\" crossover event.[15]\nStar-Lord appeared as a main character in the core series, and received a tie-in miniseries during the event, StarLord and Kitty Pryde.[16]\nAfter the Secret Wars events but two months before the event ﬁnished its publication, Star-Lord received a new\nongoing series, simply titled Star-Lord as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative, focused on his\nnew origins. He will also leave the Guardians of the Galaxy, being replaced by his ﬁancée Kitty Pryde who took\nover the identity of Star-Lord on the team's roster.[17]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n2/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nA new Star-Lord ongoing series will begin in December of 2016.\n\nFictional character biography\nWhen J'son's ship crash lands on Earth, he is taken in by Meredith Quill. The two form a relationship while\nJ'son makes repairs to his ship. Eventually, J'son is forced to leave to return home and ﬁght in a war. He leaves,\nnot knowing Meredith is pregnant with Peter Quill. 10 years later, Meredith is killed when she is attacked by\ntwo Badoon soldiers who have come to kill Peter and end J'son's blood line. Peter kills them with a shot gun,\nﬁnds his father's gun by accident, and escapes his home before it is destroyed by the Badoon ship. The Badoon\npresume Peter is killed and leave. Peter is placed in an orphanage and eventually joins NASA.[18]\nLater, when his ship malfunctions and he is stranded in space, Peter is found by the Ravagers, a group of space\npirates led by Yondu. After the Ravagers saved Peter, he tried to steal their ship. Peter managed to outsmart\nevery member of the Ravagers and even knocked out Yondu before capturing him. After he woke up, Yondu\nmanaged to set himself free from his restraints and attacked Peter and gave him a choice between letting\nhimself be released to space without more trouble or get killed right there. Peter instead asked him if he could\njoin his crew. Yondu was not sold on the idea but after he found out Peter was like him as they were both \"kids\nwithout homes\", Yondu changed his mind and let him stay in the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy.\nPeter decided to stay and try to learn everything he could from space while he was part of the Ravagers.[19]\nThe character encounters the former Herald of Galactus, the Fallen One, and is almost killed defeating the\nentity, and in addition Star-Lord's vessel \"Ship\" is destroyed in the conﬂict. The pair are subsequently\nimprisoned in the intergalactic prison the Kyln.[20][21][22][23][24] Star-Lord is freed by the hero Nova during the\nAnnihilation War and aids in the war against villain Annihilus.[25][26][27][28][29][30] Quill later acts as military\nadviser to the Kree General Ronan the Accuser.\nWhen the Kree homeworld of Hala is conquered by the Phalanx, Star-Lord leads a band of rebels against the\ninvaders until the war is over.[31][32][33][34] In an effort to prevent another interstellar war, Star-Lord forms a\nnew version of the Guardians of the Galaxy. They are \"proactive\" and try to end emerging galactic threats\nearly,[35] but are unsuccessful at preventing a war between the Kree and Shi'ar. During a war with an invading\nuniverse, Star-Lord and Nova are prepared to sacriﬁce themselves to defeat Thanos[36] but only Nova dies and\nThanos escapes.[37][38][39]\n\nNew Guardians and Kitty Pryde\nPeter decides to remain inactive for a time until he found out his father was planning to pass a law that forbade\nany interaction of extraterrestrial or space origin with Earth. Knowing this would be an open invitation for\ninvasion, Peter decides to reform the Guardians with six members: Gamora, Rocket, Groot, Drax and Bug,\nalong with himself, and start protecting Earth from any attack. Soon they aid the Avengers against the returned\nThanos.[40][41][42][43][44][45] After this, Star-Lord and his new team of Guardians engage in conﬂicts with the\nBadoon. He is soon captured by the army of Spartax but he escapes imprisonment and broadcasts a video\nshowing the unfairness of his father's reign.[46][47][48][49] During the war of the builders, he inﬁltrated the\nS.W.O.R.D. facilities and rescued Abigail Brand along with Rocket and new member Angela.[50] He also\ndeclared war against the Shi'ar empire after intervening in one of their trials to rescue the kidnapped young Jean\nGrey along with the X-Men. It was during this mission when he met Kitty Pryde, the woman with whom he\nwould initiate a romantic relationship not long after.[51][52][53] After that, all the Guardians were cornered and\ncaptured by the Spartax army. Peter was sent to Spartax where he confronted his father again and escaped after\nexposing once again his father's tyrannical reign. This time a riot formed in the Empire and J'son was deposed\nas a consequence. Peter decided to keep a low proﬁle and dedicated completely to his long distance relationship\nwith Kitty, the two eventually falling in love with each other. Soon he discovered he was elected by the Spartax\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n3/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\npeople to be their new Emperor.[54] Peter ignored the announcement and kept focusing on Kitty and his search\nfor a gangster named Mr. Knife who had put a bounty on his head. After being captured by Knife, he found out\nhis real identity was J'son, his father. He escaped thanks to Kitty and both disappeared from the radar to spend\nsome time together. Peter convinced Kitty to stay in space with him and both consummated their relationship\nbefore deciding to steal an important artifact from J'son as payback.[55]\n\nThe Black Vortex\nPeter and Kitty were successful in stealing the artifact called The Black Vortex, but found themselves\noutnumbered by J'son's killing squad so they decided to call the X-Men and the remaining Guardians for help.\nKnowing the artifact could give them the needed power to defeat J'son, Peter wanted everyone to submit to the\nVortex and gain cosmic powers. Kitty stood against the idea but some of their friends submitted anyways. After\nfailing to stop them, the submitted cosmic warriors attacked Hala and Peter went with a team to help the Kree in\nthe battle. After some failed negotiations or the Vortex, his team had to escape but J'son found them and\ndestroyed Hala in retaliation. Peter escaped on time. After ﬁnding Spartax had been completely covered in\namber by Thane, including Kitty, Peter lamented not having heard her since the beginning and apologize to her.\nKitty escaped thanks to her phasing powers and both had a reunion. Seeing no other way to defeat J'son and his\ncosmic empowered team, Peter tried to submit to the Vortex but after seeing the power would eventually make\nhim push Kitty away, he refused. Kitty ended up submitting and saving Spartax. After the war ended, Peter had\na romantic talk with Kitty where he proposes to Kitty Pryde, a proposal which she accepts.[56]\n\nSecret Wars\nWhen the universe is facing its imminent end, Star-Lord and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy come to the\nworld's ﬁnal battle against the Children of Tomorrow. During the battle, Groot and Rocket Raccoon are killed,\nand Star-Lord is teleported away by Reed Richards to his ship. In the end, he is one of the few survivors of the\napocalypse aboard the Fantastic Four's \"life raft\".[57] After the end of the universe, Doctor Doom somehow\ncreates a new, patchwork world formed from the remains of dead universes. The life raft that Star-Lord was on\nremained in cryostasis for the next eight years, until they are awakened by Doctor Strange, a new Thor, and\nMiles Morales.[58] Doom becomes aware of their location, and ambushes them. Knowing they are the only hope\nof reviving the old universe, Strange casts a spell to spread the survivors across the world using the wind, with\nDoom vowing to ﬁnd them.[59]\nStar-Lord ends up in the domain of Manhattan, where he gets a job singing in the popular club, \"the Quiet\nRoom\", singing Disney songs, as Disney ﬁlms never existed in Battleworld, using the alias of Steve Rogers to\nhide from Doom. It is here that he runs into an alternate universe version of Kitty Pryde (from the Age of\nApocalypse universe), who is hunting down artifacts from before Battleworld's creation. Hoping to talk to who\nhe believes is his ﬁancé, he accidentally messes up a deal between Kitty and Gambit to obtain an ancient\nartifact. Gambit leaves, but Kitty uses a scanner to discover that Star-Lord is from before Battleworld's creation,\nand plans on taking him to Doom. However, they are ambushed by a group of robots connected to Gambit. The\ntwo decide to steal an artifact that Gambit has, but it was a trap and the two are captured. Right before Gambit\ncan kill them, a version of Drax appears, who originally hired Peter to work in the Quiet Room, and knocks out\nGambit. The three escape with the artifact secured. When they are safe the next morning, Kitty shows it to the\ntwo, only to ﬁnd out its Rocket Racoon's tail. Star-Lord laments the death of his friend, and Kitty decides to\nallow him to keep it, as it is the one thing left of his old universe. Star-Lord thanks Kitty, who kisses him before\nheading back to her home of Doomguard. Realizing the two are out of a job for abandoning the Quiet Room in\nthe middle of a show, Star-Lord and Drax decide to go back into Star-Lord's old career as a thief. He asks Drax\nif he knows a good geneticist, as he plans on using Rocket's tail to make a clone of his friend, possibly an army\nof them.[60]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n4/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nDuring the ﬁnal stand against God Doom, Peter not only piloted a ship to take the two Reed Richards' to the\nheart of Castle Doom, but also managed to keep Black Swan occupied by using the last twig of Groot, kept in\nhis pocket ever since the Incursions to be planted at the crucial moment.[61]\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel\nFollowing the restoration of reality, Peter ascended to the throne of Spartax, with Rocket taking over leadership\nof the Guardians while Kitty- now under the alias of Star-Lady- and the Thing- following the disbanding of the\nFF while the Richards' family worked to restore the multiverse- joined the team.[62] After Kree accuser Hala\nand the ruthless Yotat the Destroyer caused mass destruction on Spartax while trying to eliminate Quill, he was\nforced to return to the Guardians due to the accusations of his delegates about his responsibility for the resulting\ndeaths.[63]\n\nPowers and abilities\nStar-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in close-quarter combat, various human and\nalien ﬁrearms, and battle techniques. He has extensive knowledge of various alien customs, societies, and\ncultures, and considerable knowledge about cosmic abstracts, such as Oblivion.\nAs Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel\nthrough space. The character uses an \"Element Gun\", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the four\nelements (air, earth, ﬁre and water). Star-Lord shares a psychic link with his sentient space vessel, \"Ship\".\n\"Ship\" is actually a sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship, but can alter her\nstructure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship\naccessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced sensors, replicators (able to form any kind of food,\ndrink, etc.), and hologram projectors. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then\nanimate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form\nis her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct\nfor those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.\n\"Ship\" can create Widgets—small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then\nreturn to her. The full extent of \"Ship's\" abilities are unknown.\nDuring Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his Element Gun, suit and \"Ship\" were destroyed. Due to severe\ninjury he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye\nimplant allows him to see all energy spectra and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% total recall.\nOn the Kree world of Aladon Prime, Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-Lord was outﬁtted\nwith a Kree-issued heat-dampening espionage battle-suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of\nthe Galaxy, a battle helmet, and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet can analyze\nstrategy data, improve vision, and regulate oxygen in space.\nStar-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including\nexplosives.\n\nOther characters named Star-Lord\nA three-issue limited series, titled Starlord, featured a man named Sinjin Quarrel adopting the identity 12 years\nafter the disappearance of the original Star-Lord (Peter Jason Quill).[64] The series, published from December\n1996 to February 1997, was written by Timothy Zahn, with art by Dan Lawlis.[65] Where the events depicted in\nthis miniseries ﬁt into Peter Quill's chronology has never been revealed.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n5/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nOther versions\nEarth-791\nStar-Lord has adventures in Marvel Preview #4 and #11, but after Peter Quill's introduction to Earth-616 in\n2004, these issues and other appearances of \"classic\" Star-Lord have been ofﬁcially designated as occurring in\nEarth-791 due to continuity issues. In these issues, Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical\nphenomenon when many of the planets align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's\nfather accuses his wife Meredith of inﬁdelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack.\nPeter is raised by his single mother until she is killed by Ariguans when he is eleven (In Earth-616, she is killed\nby Badoon soldiers).[66] Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA\nastronaut. An alien entity called the Master of the Sun later visits the space station that Quill and other\nastronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of Star-Lord (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy\ncandidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. Quill is outraged, and\nNASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scout ship, returns to the\nspace station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun ﬁrst creating\nan illusion in which the character is able to ﬁnd and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his\npast. Equipped with a sentient vessel called \"Ship\", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.[66][67]\nYears later, Star-Lord becomes involved in stopping a group of slavers who are destroying worlds. His efforts\nled him to discover a conspiracy to replace the emperor of the Spartoi Empire. In order to thwart the takeover,\nStar-Lord travels to the imperial throneworld Sparta where he encounters and kills the alien who killed his\nmother. Star-Lord then meets Emperor J'son who reveals that he is Peter's father. Jason explains that he had\ncrashed on Earth decades earlier and been rescued by Meredith Quill. During the year that he had spent\nrepairing his ship, Jason and Meredith fell in love. When it came time to leave, Jason, for Meredith's safety, had\nplaced a mindlock on her memories of him, causing her to remember their year together as only a dream.[2][67]\n\nAge of Ultron\nDuring the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, Wolverine and Susan Storm accidentally create an alternate timeline after\ntraveling back in time and assassinating Hank Pym before he can create Ultron. In the new reality, Star-Lord is\nseen as a member of the Defenders, who have replaced the defunct Avengers as the world's premier superhero\nteam.[68]\n\nIn other media\nTelevision\nStar-Lord appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \"Michael Korvac\", voiced by Steve\nDownes.[69][70]\nStar-Lord appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon series, voiced by Chris Cox.[69] In \"Guardians of\nthe Galaxy\", he is seen as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He and the Guardians of the Galaxy\nﬁght Korvac and the Chitauri with the help of Spider-Man and Nova. In \"The Return of the Guardians of\nthe Galaxy\", Star-Lord is with the Guardians of the Galaxy when they land on Earth to rebuild their ship\nat the same time when Titus was leading the Chitauri into targeting Nova's helmet.\nStar-Lord appears in Avengers Assemble, voiced by Chris Cox (in \"Guardians and Spaceknights\") and\nlater by Will Friedle (in \"Widow's Run\"). In \"Guardians and Spaceknights\", he was seen with the\nGuardians of the Galaxy when they are in the middle of evacuating the D'Bari from their homeworld\nbefore it can be consumed by Galactus. In \"Widow's Run\", Star-Lord tries to get Tony Stark to have the\nInﬁnity Gems in the custody of the Guardians of the Galaxy only to be turned down. This causes StarLord to lead the Guardians of the Galaxy into taking the Inﬁnity Gems from the Black Widow leading the\ngroup's ﬁght with the Avengers. Using special teleportation disks, the Falcon was able to send the\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n6/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy back to their ship. Star-Lord's appearance initially resembles his original comic\nbook appearance, however, now resembles Chris Pratt's character from the Guardians of the Galaxy ﬁlm.\nStar-Lord appeared in Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., voiced by Chris Cox (in \"It's a Wonderful\nSmash\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\"),[71] and by Will Friedle (in \"Planet Monster\" Pt. 2).\nStar-Lord appears in Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers episode \"Guardians of the Galaxy\".\nStar-Lord appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy animated series, voiced again by Will Friedle.[72]\n\nFilm\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nChris Pratt portrays Peter Quill / Star-Lord in the Marvel Studios ﬁlm\nGuardians of the Galaxy.[73] Peter Quill is a young boy who, unable to\naccept his mother's death due to cancer, leaves the hospital in tears, and is\nsubsequently abducted by an extraterrestrial star-ship. Twenty-six years\nlater, he is a member of the Ravagers, the mercenary gang who abducted\nhim as a child led by Yondu Udonta, and has had many adventures with\nthis crew around the galaxy. While on a scavenging job, Peter ﬁnds\nhimself embroiled in a signiﬁcant power struggle and revenge war\nbetween two advanced galactic powers, the Kree warlord Ronan the\nAccuser and Xandar's Nova Corps while also being hunted by Yondu after\nfailing to bring him a stolen relic later revealed to be an Inﬁnity Stone\nwhich Ronan seeks. Throughout the movie, Peter is shown regularly\nlistening to a cassette tape given to him by his mother (serving as his only\nconnection with Earth), containing various hit songs released between\n1967 and 1979. The ﬁlm had a major effect on Quill's appearances in\nother media as his design in the comics, video games, and cartoons was\nchanged to reﬂect Pratt's look in the movie.\nPratt will reprise his role in the upcoming ﬁlm Guardians of the Galaxy\nVol. 2, set for release May 5, 2017,[74] and again in Avengers: Inﬁnity War\nand its untitled sequel.[75]\n\nChris Pratt as Star-Lord in a\ncharacter poster for the 2014\nﬁlm Guardians of the\nGalaxy.\n\nAnimation\nStar-Lord makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the animated direct-to-video ﬁlm Planet Hulk.[76]\nHe is seen as an audience member in the Sakaar arena.\n\nVideo games\nStar-Lord is available as downloadable content for LittleBigPlanet, as part of \"Marvel Costume Kit 5\".[77]\nStar-Lord appears in Marvel Heroes.\nStar-Lord appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes.\nStar-Lord appears as a playable character in Disney Inﬁnity: Marvel Super Heroes.\nStar-Lord is available in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" skin pack for Minecraft.\nStar-Lord is available in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance as the Special Operations 20\nunlockable.\nStar-Lord is an unlockable and playable character in Marvel Contest of Champions.\nStar-Lord is an unlockable and playable character in Marvel: Future Fight.\nStar-Lord is a playable character in Disney Inﬁnity 3.0.\n\nToys\nStar-Lord was featured in the Marvel Universe toy line as a 3 3/4\" ﬁgure in his Guardian uniform.

My hero\nwould go from being an unpleasant,\nintroverted jerk to the most cosmic being in\nthe universe, and I would tie it into my thennew interest in astrology. After his\nearthbound beginning, his mind would be\nopened step by step, with a fast-action story\non Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war\nstory on Mars, and so on out to the edge of\nthe solar system, and then beyond.\n\nFlight\nAbility to travel through space\n\nBut – after his earthbound beginning, where\nI established him as an unpleasant,\nintroverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one\never saw what he was to become.[1]\nStar-Lord continued to appear in Marvel Preview, with writer Chris Claremont revamping the character and\nusing science ﬁction adventure stories like the Heinlein juveniles for inspiration.[2] Heinlein's lawyers\nthreatened legal action over the cover to Marvel Preview #11, which featured a blurb that described the content\nas \"a novel-length science ﬁction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein\", leading to the issue being\npulled and reprinted.[3] The story in #11 was the ﬁrst teaming of the celebrated X-Men creative trio of writer\nChris Claremont, penciller John Byrne, and inker Terry Austin. Star-Lord made sporadic appearances over the\nnext few years in the titles Marvel Super Special,[4] Marvel Spotlight,[5][6][7] and Marvel Premiere.[8][9] In\nFebruary 1982, a color reprint of the black-and-white Starlord story from Marvel Preview #11 was published\nwith a new framing sequence by Claremont and artist Michael Golden.[10][11]\nThe character returned in Thanos #8–12 (May–Sept. 2004) and Annihilation #1-6 (2006). The following year,\nhe received a four issue eponymous title (Annihilation: Conquest – Star-Lord) leading into the \"Annihilation:\nConquest\" crossover storyline, in which he played a central role. Spinning out of \"Annihilation: Conquest\", a\nsecond volume of Guardians of the Galaxy featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by\nStar-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run. Plot lines from that series were concluded in the The\nThanos Imperative mini-series.\nAfter Star-Lord's introduction to Earth-616 in 2004, the appearances of \"classic\" Star-Lord have been ofﬁcially\ndesignated as occurring in Earth-791 due to continuity issues.[12]\nStar-Lord returned, along with other members of the Guardians, in Avengers Assemble #4-8 (June–Oct. 2012).\nHe stars in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, a part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch.[13]\nIn July 2014, Star-Lord received his own ongoing series, Legendary Star-Lord. The character was also given a\nnew costume, matching that seen in the Marvel Studios ﬁlm Guardians of the Galaxy [14]\nHis solo series and Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 ended as Marvel began its \"Secret Wars\" crossover event.[15]\nStar-Lord appeared as a main character in the core series, and received a tie-in miniseries during the event, StarLord and Kitty Pryde.[16]\nAfter the Secret Wars events but two months before the event ﬁnished its publication, Star-Lord received a new\nongoing series, simply titled Star-Lord as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative, focused on his\nnew origins. He will also leave the Guardians of the Galaxy, being replaced by his ﬁancée Kitty Pryde who took\nover the identity of Star-Lord on the team's roster.[17]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n2/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nA new Star-Lord ongoing series will begin in December of 2016.\n\nFictional character biography\nWhen J'son's ship crash lands on Earth, he is taken in by Meredith Quill. The two form a relationship while\nJ'son makes repairs to his ship. Eventually, J'son is forced to leave to return home and ﬁght in a war. He leaves,\nnot knowing Meredith is pregnant with Peter Quill. 10 years later, Meredith is killed when she is attacked by\ntwo Badoon soldiers who have come to kill Peter and end J'son's blood line. Peter kills them with a shot gun,\nﬁnds his father's gun by accident, and escapes his home before it is destroyed by the Badoon ship. The Badoon\npresume Peter is killed and leave. Peter is placed in an orphanage and eventually joins NASA.[18]\nLater, when his ship malfunctions and he is stranded in space, Peter is found by the Ravagers, a group of space\npirates led by Yondu. After the Ravagers saved Peter, he tried to steal their ship. Peter managed to outsmart\nevery member of the Ravagers and even knocked out Yondu before capturing him. After he woke up, Yondu\nmanaged to set himself free from his restraints and attacked Peter and gave him a choice between letting\nhimself be released to space without more trouble or get killed right there. Peter instead asked him if he could\njoin his crew. Yondu was not sold on the idea but after he found out Peter was like him as they were both \"kids\nwithout homes\", Yondu changed his mind and let him stay in the ship with the Ravagers as their cleaning boy.\nPeter decided to stay and try to learn everything he could from space while he was part of the Ravagers.[19]\nThe character encounters the former Herald of Galactus, the Fallen One, and is almost killed defeating the\nentity, and in addition Star-Lord's vessel \"Ship\" is destroyed in the conﬂict. The pair are subsequently\nimprisoned in the intergalactic prison the Kyln.[20][21][22][23][24] Star-Lord is freed by the hero Nova during the\nAnnihilation War and aids in the war against villain Annihilus.[25][26][27][28][29][30] Quill later acts as military\nadviser to the Kree General Ronan the Accuser.\nWhen the Kree homeworld of Hala is conquered by the Phalanx, Star-Lord leads a band of rebels against the\ninvaders until the war is over.[31][32][33][34] In an effort to prevent another interstellar war, Star-Lord forms a\nnew version of the Guardians of the Galaxy. They are \"proactive\" and try to end emerging galactic threats\nearly,[35] but are unsuccessful at preventing a war between the Kree and Shi'ar. During a war with an invading\nuniverse, Star-Lord and Nova are prepared to sacriﬁce themselves to defeat Thanos[36] but only Nova dies and\nThanos escapes.[37][38][39]\n\nNew Guardians and Kitty Pryde\nPeter decides to remain inactive for a time until he found out his father was planning to pass a law that forbade\nany interaction of extraterrestrial or space origin with Earth. Knowing this would be an open invitation for\ninvasion, Peter decides to reform the Guardians with six members: Gamora, Rocket, Groot, Drax and Bug,\nalong with himself, and start protecting Earth from any attack. Soon they aid the Avengers against the returned\nThanos.[40][41][42][43][44][45] After this, Star-Lord and his new team of Guardians engage in conﬂicts with the\nBadoon. He is soon captured by the army of Spartax but he escapes imprisonment and broadcasts a video\nshowing the unfairness of his father's reign.[46][47][48][49] During the war of the builders, he inﬁltrated the\nS.W.O.R.D. facilities and rescued Abigail Brand along with Rocket and new member Angela.[50] He also\ndeclared war against the Shi'ar empire after intervening in one of their trials to rescue the kidnapped young Jean\nGrey along with the X-Men. It was during this mission when he met Kitty Pryde, the woman with whom he\nwould initiate a romantic relationship not long after.[51][52][53] After that, all the Guardians were cornered and\ncaptured by the Spartax army. Peter was sent to Spartax where he confronted his father again and escaped after\nexposing once again his father's tyrannical reign. This time a riot formed in the Empire and J'son was deposed\nas a consequence. Peter decided to keep a low proﬁle and dedicated completely to his long distance relationship\nwith Kitty, the two eventually falling in love with each other. Soon he discovered he was elected by the Spartax\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n3/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\npeople to be their new Emperor.[54] Peter ignored the announcement and kept focusing on Kitty and his search\nfor a gangster named Mr. Knife who had put a bounty on his head. After being captured by Knife, he found out\nhis real identity was J'son, his father. He escaped thanks to Kitty and both disappeared from the radar to spend\nsome time together. Peter convinced Kitty to stay in space with him and both consummated their relationship\nbefore deciding to steal an important artifact from J'son as payback.[55]\n\nThe Black Vortex\nPeter and Kitty were successful in stealing the artifact called The Black Vortex, but found themselves\noutnumbered by J'son's killing squad so they decided to call the X-Men and the remaining Guardians for help.\nKnowing the artifact could give them the needed power to defeat J'son, Peter wanted everyone to submit to the\nVortex and gain cosmic powers. Kitty stood against the idea but some of their friends submitted anyways. After\nfailing to stop them, the submitted cosmic warriors attacked Hala and Peter went with a team to help the Kree in\nthe battle. After some failed negotiations or the Vortex, his team had to escape but J'son found them and\ndestroyed Hala in retaliation. Peter escaped on time. After ﬁnding Spartax had been completely covered in\namber by Thane, including Kitty, Peter lamented not having heard her since the beginning and apologize to her.\nKitty escaped thanks to her phasing powers and both had a reunion. Seeing no other way to defeat J'son and his\ncosmic empowered team, Peter tried to submit to the Vortex but after seeing the power would eventually make\nhim push Kitty away, he refused. Kitty ended up submitting and saving Spartax. After the war ended, Peter had\na romantic talk with Kitty where he proposes to Kitty Pryde, a proposal which she accepts.[56]\n\nSecret Wars\nWhen the universe is facing its imminent end, Star-Lord and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy come to the\nworld's ﬁnal battle against the Children of Tomorrow. During the battle, Groot and Rocket Raccoon are killed,\nand Star-Lord is teleported away by Reed Richards to his ship. In the end, he is one of the few survivors of the\napocalypse aboard the Fantastic Four's \"life raft\".[57] After the end of the universe, Doctor Doom somehow\ncreates a new, patchwork world formed from the remains of dead universes. The life raft that Star-Lord was on\nremained in cryostasis for the next eight years, until they are awakened by Doctor Strange, a new Thor, and\nMiles Morales.[58] Doom becomes aware of their location, and ambushes them. Knowing they are the only hope\nof reviving the old universe, Strange casts a spell to spread the survivors across the world using the wind, with\nDoom vowing to ﬁnd them.[59]\nStar-Lord ends up in the domain of Manhattan, where he gets a job singing in the popular club, \"the Quiet\nRoom\", singing Disney songs, as Disney ﬁlms never existed in Battleworld, using the alias of Steve Rogers to\nhide from Doom. It is here that he runs into an alternate universe version of Kitty Pryde (from the Age of\nApocalypse universe), who is hunting down artifacts from before Battleworld's creation. Hoping to talk to who\nhe believes is his ﬁancé, he accidentally messes up a deal between Kitty and Gambit to obtain an ancient\nartifact. Gambit leaves, but Kitty uses a scanner to discover that Star-Lord is from before Battleworld's creation,\nand plans on taking him to Doom. However, they are ambushed by a group of robots connected to Gambit. The\ntwo decide to steal an artifact that Gambit has, but it was a trap and the two are captured. Right before Gambit\ncan kill them, a version of Drax appears, who originally hired Peter to work in the Quiet Room, and knocks out\nGambit. The three escape with the artifact secured. When they are safe the next morning, Kitty shows it to the\ntwo, only to ﬁnd out its Rocket Racoon's tail. Star-Lord laments the death of his friend, and Kitty decides to\nallow him to keep it, as it is the one thing left of his old universe. Star-Lord thanks Kitty, who kisses him before\nheading back to her home of Doomguard. Realizing the two are out of a job for abandoning the Quiet Room in\nthe middle of a show, Star-Lord and Drax decide to go back into Star-Lord's old career as a thief. He asks Drax\nif he knows a good geneticist, as he plans on using Rocket's tail to make a clone of his friend, possibly an army\nof them.[60]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n4/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nDuring the ﬁnal stand against God Doom, Peter not only piloted a ship to take the two Reed Richards' to the\nheart of Castle Doom, but also managed to keep Black Swan occupied by using the last twig of Groot, kept in\nhis pocket ever since the Incursions to be planted at the crucial moment.[61]\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel\nFollowing the restoration of reality, Peter ascended to the throne of Spartax, with Rocket taking over leadership\nof the Guardians while Kitty- now under the alias of Star-Lady- and the Thing- following the disbanding of the\nFF while the Richards' family worked to restore the multiverse- joined the team.[62] After Kree accuser Hala\nand the ruthless Yotat the Destroyer caused mass destruction on Spartax while trying to eliminate Quill, he was\nforced to return to the Guardians due to the accusations of his delegates about his responsibility for the resulting\ndeaths.[63]\n\nPowers and abilities\nStar-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in close-quarter combat, various human and\nalien ﬁrearms, and battle techniques. He has extensive knowledge of various alien customs, societies, and\ncultures, and considerable knowledge about cosmic abstracts, such as Oblivion.\nAs Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel\nthrough space. The character uses an \"Element Gun\", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the four\nelements (air, earth, ﬁre and water). Star-Lord shares a psychic link with his sentient space vessel, \"Ship\".\n\"Ship\" is actually a sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship, but can alter her\nstructure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship\naccessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced sensors, replicators (able to form any kind of food,\ndrink, etc.), and hologram projectors. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then\nanimate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form\nis her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct\nfor those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.\n\"Ship\" can create Widgets—small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then\nreturn to her. The full extent of \"Ship's\" abilities are unknown.\nDuring Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his Element Gun, suit and \"Ship\" were destroyed. Due to severe\ninjury he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye\nimplant allows him to see all energy spectra and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% total recall.\nOn the Kree world of Aladon Prime, Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-Lord was outﬁtted\nwith a Kree-issued heat-dampening espionage battle-suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of\nthe Galaxy, a battle helmet, and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet can analyze\nstrategy data, improve vision, and regulate oxygen in space.\nStar-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including\nexplosives.\n\nOther characters named Star-Lord\nA three-issue limited series, titled Starlord, featured a man named Sinjin Quarrel adopting the identity 12 years\nafter the disappearance of the original Star-Lord (Peter Jason Quill).[64] The series, published from December\n1996 to February 1997, was written by Timothy Zahn, with art by Dan Lawlis.[65] Where the events depicted in\nthis miniseries ﬁt into Peter Quill's chronology has never been revealed.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord\n\n5/10\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nStar-Lord - Wikipedia\n\nOther versions\nEarth-791\nStar-Lord has adventures in Marvel Preview #4 and #11, but after Peter Quill's introduction to Earth-616 in\n2004, these issues and other appearances of \"classic\" Star-Lord have been ofﬁcially designated as occurring in\nEarth-791 due to continuity issues. In these issues, Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical\nphenomenon when many of the planets align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's\nfather accuses his wife Meredith of inﬁdelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack.\nPeter is raised by his single mother until she is killed by Ariguans when he is eleven (In Earth-616, she is killed\nby Badoon soldiers).[66] Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA\nastronaut. An alien entity called the Master of the Sun later visits the space station that Quill and other\nastronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of Star-Lord (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy\ncandidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. Quill is outraged, and\nNASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scout ship, returns to the\nspace station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun ﬁrst creating\nan illusion in which the character is able to ﬁnd and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his\npast. Equipped with a sentient vessel called \"Ship\", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.[66][67]\nYears later, Star-Lord becomes involved in stopping a group of slavers who are destroying worlds. His efforts\nled him to discover a conspiracy to replace the emperor of the Spartoi Empire. In order to thwart the takeover,\nStar-Lord travels to the imperial throneworld Sparta where he encounters and kills the alien who killed his\nmother. Star-Lord then meets Emperor J'son who reveals that he is Peter's father. Jason explains that he had\ncrashed on Earth decades earlier and been rescued by Meredith Quill. During the year that he had spent\nrepairing his ship, Jason and Meredith fell in love. When it came time to leave, Jason, for Meredith's safety, had\nplaced a mindlock on her memories of him, causing her to remember their year together as only a dream.[2][67]\n\nAge of Ultron\nDuring the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, Wolverine and Susan Storm accidentally create an alternate timeline after\ntraveling back in time and assassinating Hank Pym before he can create Ultron. In the new reality, Star-Lord is\nseen as a member of the Defenders, who have replaced the defunct Avengers as the world's premier superhero\nteam.[68]\n\nIn other media\nTelevision\nStar-Lord appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \"Michael Korvac\", voiced by Steve\nDownes.[69][70]\nStar-Lord appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon series, voiced by Chris Cox.[69] In \"Guardians of\nthe Galaxy\", he is seen as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He and the Guardians of the Galaxy\nﬁght Korvac and the Chitauri with the help of Spider-Man and Nova. In \"The Return of the Guardians of\nthe Galaxy\", Star-Lord is with the Guardians of the Galaxy when they land on Earth to rebuild their ship\nat the same time when Titus was leading the Chitauri into targeting Nova's helmet.\nStar-Lord appears in Avengers Assemble, voiced by Chris Cox (in \"Guardians and Spaceknights\") and\nlater by Will Friedle (in \"Widow's Run\"). In \"Guardians and Spaceknights\", he was seen with the\nGuardians of the Galaxy when they are in the middle of evacuating the D'Bari from their homeworld\nbefore it can be consumed by Galactus. In \"Widow's Run\", Star-Lord tries to get Tony Stark to have the\nInﬁnity Gems in the custody of the Guardians of the Galaxy only to be turned down. This causes StarLord to lead the Guardians of the Galaxy into taking the Inﬁnity Gems from the Black Widow leading the\ngroup's ﬁght with the Avengers.

Throughout the movie, Peter is shown regularly\nlistening to a cassette tape given to him by his mother (serving as his only\nconnection with Earth), containing various hit songs released between\n1967 and 1979.

The character\nwas created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill\n\nBatman\n\nFinger,[4][5] and ﬁrst appeared in Detective Comics #27\n(1939). Originally named the \"Bat-Man\", the character is\nalso referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader,\nthe Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.[6]\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American\nbillionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne\nEnterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents\nThomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore\nvengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a\nsense of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and\nintellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to ﬁght\ncrime.[7] Batman operates in the ﬁctional Gotham City,\nwith assistance from various supporting characters,\nincluding his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon,\nand vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most\nsuperheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers;\nrather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess,\nmartial arts abilities, detective skills, science and\ntechnology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable\nwill. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's\nrogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.\nBatman became popular soon after his introduction in\n1939 and gained his own comic book title, Batman, the\nfollowing year. As the decades went on, differing\ninterpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s\nBatman television series used a camp aesthetic, which\ncontinued to be associated with the character for years\nafter the show ended.

In response, Bob Kane created \"the Bat-Man\".[10]\nCollaborator Bill Finger recalled that \"Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see\nthe drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with\nkind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small domino mask, swinging\non a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ...\nBATMAN\".[11] The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's sketch of\nan ornithopter ﬂying device as a child.[12]\nFinger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and\ngloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume.[14][15][16][17] Finger said he\ndevised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: \"Bruce Wayne's ﬁrst name came from Robert\nBruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would\nsuggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.\"[18] He later said his\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\nsuggestions were inﬂuenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a\n\n2/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nsuggestions were inﬂuenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a\nsyndicated newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also\nfamiliar.[19]\nKane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for\ninspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods,\nand weaponry. Details ﬁnd predecessors in pulp ﬁction, comic strips,\nnewspaper headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane\nhimself.[20] As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had\nFirst image of Batman, in Action\npredecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel (created by Baroness Emmuska\nComics #12, announcing the\nOrczy, 1903) and Zorro (created by Johnston McCulley, 1919). Like\ncharacter's debut in the forthcoming\nthem, he performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by\nDetective Comics #27[13]\nplaying aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol.\nKane noted the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms The Mark of Zorro (1920) and The\nBat Whispers (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes\nlike Doc Savage, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes, made the character a master sleuth.[21][22]\nIn his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:\nOne day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some\ncrude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.' He came over and I showed him the drawings.\nAt the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill\nsaid, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and\njust put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red\nunion suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good\ncombination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more\nominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we\nrealized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action, and changed them\ninto a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was ﬁghting or swinging down on a rope.\nAlso, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave ﬁngerprints.[19]\n\nGolden Age\nSubsequent creation credit\nKane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline\non all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say \"Batman created by Bob Kane\"; his name was simply\nwritten on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced\nby credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began\nreceiving a \"created by\" credit on the Superman titles, along with William Moulton Marston being given the\nbyline for creating Wonder Woman, Batman stories began saying \"Created by Bob Kane\" in addition to the\nother credits.\nFinger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he\nbegan, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of Batman\n#169 (February 1965) for example, editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler, one of\nBatman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline.\nKane wrote, \"Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not\nused his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.\"[18] At the time of Finger's death in\n1974, DC had not ofﬁcially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n3/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nJerry Robinson, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing\nto share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with The Comics\nJournal:\nBob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in\nany of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why ... [he was] going to leave\n[Kane's employ]. ... [Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there. ...\nThat was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital\nrole in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same\nco-creator credit in the strip, writer, and artist.[23]\nAlthough Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to\nfans that \"it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the\n''Batman, t' [sic] as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent\nand entirely untrue.\" Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. \"The trouble with being a 'ghost'\nwriter or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit',\nthen one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator.\"[24]\nIn 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview:\nIn those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of\nDC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never\nappear on the comic book in the ﬁnished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I\nnever volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.[25]\nIn September 2015, DC Entertainment revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman's\ncreation on the 2016 superhero ﬁlm Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the second season of Gotham\nafter a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC.[4] Finger received credit as a creator of Batman\nfor the ﬁrst time in a comic in October 2015 with Batman and Robin Eternal #3 and Batman: Arkham Knight\nGenesis #3. The updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as \"Batman created by Bob Kane with\nBill Finger\".[5]\nEarly years\nThe ﬁrst Batman story, \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\", was published in Detective Comics #27 (May\n1939). Finger said, \"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps\",[26] and this inﬂuence was evident\nwith Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he\nreceived his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in Detective Comics. By that time, Detective\nComics was the top-selling and most inﬂuential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other\nmajor hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.[27] The two characters were featured\nside-by-side as the stars of World's Finest Comics, which was originally titled World's Best Comics when it\ndebuted in fall 1940. Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this\nperiod.\nOver the course of the ﬁrst few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of\nBatman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and\nlengthened the ears on the costume. \"About a year later he was almost the full ﬁgure, my mature Batman\", Kane\nsaid.[28] Batman's characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939), followed by\nthe boomerang-like batarang and the ﬁrst bat-themed vehicle, the Batplane, in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\norigin was revealed in #33\n\n(Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story\n\n4/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\norigin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story\nthat establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by\nthe death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce\nWayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days\nlater, at their grave, the child vows that \"by the spirits of my parents [I\nwill] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all\ncriminals\".[29][30][31]\nThe early, pulp-inﬂected portrayal of Batman started to soften in\nDetective Comics #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of Robin,\nBatman's junior counterpart.[32] Robin was introduced, based on\nFinger's suggestion, because Batman needed a \"Watson\" with whom\nBatman could talk.[33] Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference\nfor a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of \"kid sidekicks\".[34]\nThe ﬁrst issue of the solo spin-off series Batman was notable not only\nfor introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the Joker and\nCatwoman, but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous\ngiants to death. That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree\nthat the character could no longer kill or use a gun.[35]\n\nBatman made his debut in Detective\nComics #27 (May 1939); cover art by\nBob Kane.\n\nBy 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the\nBatman mythos.[36] In the years following World War II, DC Comics \"adopted a postwar editorial direction that\nincreasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy\". The impact of this\neditorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period; removed from the \"bleak and menacing\nworld\" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal ﬁgure\nthat inhabited a \"bright and colorful\" environment.[37]\n\nSilver and Bronze Age\n1950s and early 1960s\nBatman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned\nduring the 1950s. In the story \"The Mightiest Team in the World\" in Superman #76 (June 1952), Batman teams\nup with Superman for the ﬁrst time and the pair discovers each other's secret identity.[38] Following the success\nof this story, World's Finest Comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of\nthe separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.[39] The team-up of the characters was\n\"a ﬁnancial success in an era when those were few and far between\";[40] this series of stories ran until the book's\ncancellation in 1986.\nBatman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the\npublication of psychologist Fredric Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent in 1954. Wertham's thesis was\nthat children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth.\nWertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin\nwere portrayed as lovers.[41] Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to\nthe establishment of the Comics Code Authority, a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The\ntendency towards a \"sunnier Batman\" in the postwar years intensiﬁed after the introduction of the Comics\nCode.[42] Scholars have suggested that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and the pre-Barbara Gordon BatGirl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories\ntook on a campier, lighter feel.[43]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n5/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nIn the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science ﬁction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the\nsuccess of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.[44] New characters such as Batwoman, Ace the\nBat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre\nspace aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in The Brave and the\nBold #28 (Feb. 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.\n\"New Look\" Batman and camp\nBy 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was \"planning to kill\nBatman off altogether\".[45] In response to this, editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles. He\npresided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), which was coverbilled as the \"New Look\". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to\nreturn him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the\ncharacter. The Batmobile was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modiﬁed to incorporate a yellow ellipse\nbehind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and\nBat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed)\nwhile a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick\nGrayson.[46]\nThe debut of the Batman television series in 1966 had a profound inﬂuence on the character. The success of the\nseries increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and Batman reached a circulation of close to 900,000\ncopies.[47] Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show's campy nature were introduced into the\ncomics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful\nfor a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the\nBatman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, \"When the television show\nwas a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books.\"[48]\nStarting in 1969, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from\nthe campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a \"grim avenger of the\nnight\".[49] O'Neil said his idea was \"simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read\nsome of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\"[50]\nO'Neil and Adams ﬁrst collaborated on the story \"The Secret of the Waiting Graves\" (Detective Comics #395,\nJanuary 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker Dick\nGiordano, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s;\nnevertheless the inﬂuence of their work was \"tremendous\".[51] Giordano said: \"We went back to a grimmer,\ndarker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well ...\"[52] While the work of O'Neil and Adams was\npopular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly\nacclaimed run by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Marshall Rogers in Detective Comics #471–476 (August\n1977 – April 1978), which went on to inﬂuence the 1989 movie Batman and be adapted for Batman: The\nAnimated Series, which debuted in 1992.[53] Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and\n1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.[54]\n\nModern Age\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nFrank Miller's limited series The Dark Knight Returns (February–June 1986) returned the character to his\ndarker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out\nof retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated the character. The Dark Knight Returns was a ﬁnancial success\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n6/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nand has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.[55] The series also sparked a major\nresurgence in the character's popularity.[56]\nThat year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of\nBatman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries Crisis on Inﬁnite Earths. O'Neil operated under the\nassumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books\nthan had gone before.[57] One outcome of this new approach was the \"Year One\" storyline in Batman #404–407\n(February–May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redeﬁned the character's origins.\nWriter Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page one-shot Batman:\nThe Killing Joke, in which the Joker, attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane, cripples Gordon's\ndaughter Barbara, and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.\nThe Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a 900 number for readers to call\nto vote on whether Jason Todd, the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a\nnarrow margin of 28 votes (see Batman: A Death in the Family).[58]\nKnightfall\nThe 1993 \"Knightfall\" story arc introduced a new villain, Bane, who critically injures Batman after pushing him\nto the limits of his endurance. Jean-Paul Valley, known as Azrael, is called upon to wear the Batsuit during\nBruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, and Alan Grant worked on the Batman\ntitles during \"Knightfall\", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's\n\"Cataclysm\" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's \"No Man's Land\", a year-long storyline that ran through\nall the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion\nof \"No Man's Land\", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck.\nAnother writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was Jeph Loeb. Along with longtime\ncollaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries (\"The Long Halloween\" and \"Dark Victory\") that pit an early\nin his career version of Batman against his entire rogues gallery (most notably Two-Face, whose origin was reenvisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman. In\n2003, Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to work on another mystery arc: \"Batman: Hush\" for the main Batman\nbook. The twelve–issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery,\nincluding an apparently resurrected Jason Todd, while seeking to ﬁnd the identity of the mysterious supervillain\nHush. While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. As the\nstoryline was Jim Lee's ﬁrst regular comic book work in nearly a decade, the series became #1 on the Diamond\nComic Distributors sales chart for the ﬁrst time since Batman #500 (October 1993) and Jason Todd's appearance\nlaid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick's subsequent run as writer on Batman, with another multi-issue\nepic, \"Under the Hood\", which ran from Batman #637–650.\nAll-Star Batman and Robin\nIn 2005, DC launched All-Star Batman and Robin, a stand-alone comic series set outside the existing DC\nUniverse. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC\nComics[59][60] though widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence.[61][62]\nStarting in 2006, Grant Morrison and Paul Dini were the regular writers of Batman and Detective Comics, with\nMorrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the\nscience ﬁction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations\nBatman suffered under the inﬂuence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training.\nMorrison's run climaxed with \"Batman R.I.P.\", which brought Batman up against the villainous \"Black Glove\"\norganization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. \"Batman R.I.P.\" segued into Final Crisis (also\nwritten by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid. In the 2009 miniseries\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n7/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nBatman: Battle for the Cowl, Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son\nDamian becomes the new Robin.[63][64] In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing Batman, while Grant\nMorrison was given his own series, titled Batman and Robin.[65]\nIn 2010, the storyline Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne saw Bruce travel through history, eventually\nreturning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue\nbeing Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his war on crime globally, which is the central focus of Batman\nIncorporated. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in Batman,\nDetective Comics, and Batman and Robin, while Wayne would be the main character in Batman Incorporated.\nAlso, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, Batman: The Dark Knight.\nThe New 52\nIn September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero books, including its Batman franchise, were canceled\nand relaunched with new #1 issues as part of the New 52 reboot. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be\nidentiﬁed as Batman and is featured in Batman, Detective Comics, Batman and Robin, and Batman: The Dark\nKnight. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many\ncharacters have their histories signiﬁcantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly\nintact. Batman Incorporated was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the \"Leviathan\" storyline.\nSince the beginning of the New 52, Scott Snyder has been the writer of the ﬂagship Batman title. His ﬁrst major\nstory arc was \"Night of the Owls\", where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a secret society that has\ncontrolled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was \"Death of the Family\", where the Joker returns to\nGotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was \"Batman: Zero\nYear\", which redeﬁned Batman's origin in The New 52. It followed Batman #0, published in June 2012, which\nexplored the character's early years. The ﬁnal storyline before the Convergence (2015) event was Endgame,\ndepicting the supposed ﬁnal battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus\nonto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.\nStarting with #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, mechaBatman, debuting in the Free Comic Book Day special comic Divergence. However, Bruce Wayne is soon\nrevealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his\nlife as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne ﬁnds happiness and proposes to his\ngirlfriend, Julie, but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to\ndestroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a \"strange star\" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne\ndiscovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that\nthis is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories\nas the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor.\nGordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shuttered.[66]\nIn 2015, DC Comics released The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, the sequel to Frank Miller's The Dark\nKnight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again.[67]\nDC Rebirth\nIn June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles. Batman was\nrebooted with a one-shot issue and began shipping twice-monthly, starting with Batman vol. 3, #1 (June 2016).\nThe series was written by Tom King, and artwork was provided by David Finch and Mikel Janín. The Batman\nseries introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl. Detective Comics resumed its original numbering\nsystem starting with June 2016's #934, and the New 52 volume 2 of the series was added into volume 1.[68]\nWriter James Tynion IV and artists Eddy Barrows and Alvaro Martinez worked on Detective Comics #934, and\nthe series initially featured a team consisting of Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, Cassandra Cain and Clayface, led\nby Batman and Batwoman.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n8/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nCharacterization\nBruce Wayne\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy\nAmerican industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the\nmurder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne,\nwhich ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and\nseek vengeance against criminals. He resides just outside of\nGotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor.\nWayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superﬁcial\nplayboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was\namassed through investment in real estate before the city\nbecame a bustling metropolis,[69] and the proﬁts of Wayne\n\nBruce Wayne in Batman vol. 2; art by Greg\nCapullo.\n\nEnterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[70] He supports\nphilanthropic causes through his nonproﬁt Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity\nsocialite.[71] In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid\ngossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most\nof his time.[72]\nWriters of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary\ndepending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison[73] notes that both heroes \"believe in the\nsame kind of things\" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast\nin their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: \"Bruce has a butler, Clark\nhas a boss.\" T. James Musler's book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce\nWayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his crusade against\ncrime.[74]\nModern stories tend to portray the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade[75] (in counterpoint\nto the post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the\nfacade).[76][77] In Batman Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology of the character,\nbehavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent\nhumanity; that \"Batman, for all its beneﬁts and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool\nfor Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better\".\nWill Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that \"the conﬁrmation of the Batman's identity lies with the\nyoung audience ... he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most\nimportantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ... and they're never\nwrong.\"[78]\nDuring the character's creation, the name \"Bruce Wayne\" was chosen for certain connotations. According to cocreator Bill Finger, \"Bruce Wayne's ﬁrst name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a\nplayboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ...\nthen I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.\"[79]\nPersonality\nBatman's primary character traits can be summarized as \"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and\nobsession\".[80] The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative\nteams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n9/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\n\"Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the\nBold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want\nto coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days.\"[81]\nThe driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill\nFinger discussed Batman's background and decided that \"there's nothing more traumatic than having your\nparents murdered before your eyes\".[82] Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a\nscientist[83][84] and to train his body into physical perfection[83][84] to ﬁght crime in Gotham City as Batman, an\ninspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.[83][84]\nAnother of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of\nhis parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by\ndifferent artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never\nvaried at all in the comic books, the \"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent\nexpressions\".[85] The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the\ncharacter's adventures.[80]\nBatman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as \"a\ndionysian ﬁgure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order\".[86] Dressed as a bat, Batman\ndeliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-ﬁghting,[87] a fear that originates from\nthe criminals' own guilty conscience.[88] Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into\nBatman's characterization,[89] such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and\nincreasingly alienated behavior. Batman's original character was changed in the 1950s when the now-defunct\ncomic book codes went into effect, and DC editor Whitney Ellsworth reinvented Batman as having a stringent\nmoral code which never allowed him to kill.[89] Miller's Batman was closer to the original, Golden Age version,\nwho was willing to kill criminals if necessary.[90]\n\nOthers\nOn two occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman. He served brieﬂy while Wayne recovered\nfrom spinal injuries caused by Bane in the 1993 Knightfall storyline. He assumed the mantle again in a 2009\ncomic book while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in\n2010. As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint\ncrossover event.\nIn an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin\nrepresented a \"reverse\" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, \"a more light-hearted and\nspontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin\". Morrison explained his intentions for the new\ncharacterization of Batman: \"Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's\npartner since he was a kid, he's led the Teen Titans, and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's\na very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; He's a lot looser and more relaxed.\"[63]\nOver the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to ofﬁcially take over for\nBruce during his leaves of absence. Jean Paul Valley, also known as Azrael, assumed the cowl after the events\nof the Knightfall saga. James Gordon, donned a mech-suit after the events of Batman: Endgame, and served as\nBatman in 2015 and 2016.\nAdditionally, members of the group Batman, Incorporated, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand\nof vigilantism, have at times stood in as the ofﬁcial Batman in cities around the world. Various others have also\ntaken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them,\nvarious former proteges of Bruce Wayne.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n10/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nAbilities\nSkills and training\nBatman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on \"his own scientiﬁc knowledge, detective skills, and\nathletic prowess\".[32] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a\nproﬁcient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is\nregarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver.[91] Batman has been\nrepeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC\nUniverse, and having peak human physical conditioning.[92] As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in\ncountless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe.[93] He has traveled the\nworld acquiring the skills needed to aid in his crusade against crime. In the Superman: Doomed story arc,\nSuperman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.[94]\nBatman has trained extensively in various martial arts, mastering over 127 different types, making him one of\nthe best hand-to-hand ﬁghters in the DC Universe. Superman describes Batman as \"the most dangerous man on\nEarth\", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his\nimprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's ﬁrst storyline in JLA.\nBatman has the ability to function under great physical pain and to withstand telepathy and mind control. He is\na master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering information under the identity of\nMatches Malone, a notorious gangster. He is a master of stealth and escapology, which allows him to appear\nand disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm.\nBatman is an expert in interrogation techniques and often uses extreme methods to extract information from\nsuspects, such as hanging a person over the edge of a building. His intimidating and frightening appearance\nalone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his\nenemies, Batman's most deﬁning characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a\nlife. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most\nnotably that of Superman and Wonder Woman.\nAmong physical and other crime ﬁghting related training, he is also proﬁcient at other types of skills. Some of\nthese include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the Batplane), as well as being able to operate other\ntypes of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.\n\nTechnology\nPersonal armor\nBatman's body armored costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.[95] The details\nof the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations,\nbut the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a\npair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane\noriginally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring\ncalled for black to be highlighted with blue.[95] Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark\nblue and grey;[95] as well as black and grey. In the Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns ﬁlms, Batman has\nbeen depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. Christopher\nNolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a\nblack bat in the middle. Ben Afﬂeck's Batman in the DC Extended Universe ﬁlms wears a suit more faithful to\nthe comic books versions, in which the suit is grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n11/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nBatman's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It\nprotects him from gunﬁre and other signiﬁcant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude\nfrom long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the\nscallops.[96] The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies\ngreatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, \"We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in\nthe Batcave so they don't have to look the same ... Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to\nput their own spin on it.\"[97]\nBatmobile\nBatman's primary vehicle is the Batmobile, which is usually depicted as\nan imposing black car, often with tailﬁns that suggest a bat's wings.\nBatman also has an aircraft called the Batplane (later called the\n\"Batwing\"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper\npractice, the \"bat\" preﬁx (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by\nBatman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some\nportrayals (primarily the 1960s Batman live-action television show and\nthe Super Friends animated series) stretched the practice to campy\nproportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a Batboat,\nBat-Sub, and Batcycle, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s\nThe 1966 television Batmobile, built\ntelevision series Batman has an arsenal that includes such \"bat-\" names\nby George Barris from a Lincoln\nas the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, batFutura concept car\ndrinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-ﬁlter, bat-shark\nrepellent bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline \"A Death in the Family\"\nsuggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the \"bat\" preﬁx on his own. In The\nDark Knight Returns, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name \"Batmobile\"\nwhen he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in\n2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier armor\nand new aesthetics.\nUtility belt\nBatman keeps most of his ﬁeld equipment in his utility belt. Over the years it has shown to contain an\nassortment of crime-ﬁghting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions\nof the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around\nit. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a\ncable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of\nGotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are guns, which he refuses to use on principle,\nsince a gun was used in his parents' murder.\nBat-Signal\nWhen Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens\ncalled the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be\nseen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.\nIn various incarnations, most notably the 1960s Batman TV series, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated\nphone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a\nwooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, Wayne\nManor, speciﬁcally both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone\nin the Batcave.\nBatcave\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n12/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion,\nWayne Manor. It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his\nvehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic\nBatman: Shadow of the Bat (issue #45) and the 2005 ﬁlm Batman Begins, the cave is said to have been part of\nthe Underground Railroad.\nOther equipment\nBatman uses a large arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs\nof which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept\nof Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939) and the ﬁrst\nbat-themed weapons the batarang and the \"Batgyro\" in Detective Comics #31 and #32 (September; October\n1939).[28]\n\nSupporting characters\nBatman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of\ncharacters.[80]\n\nAdversaries\nBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to\noutlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's\ncharacter and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead\nthem to a life of crime.[98] These foes are commonly referred to as\nBatman's \"rogues gallery\". Batman's \"most implacable foe\" is the Joker,\na homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is\nconsidered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the\nantithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a\nmaniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a\nserious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a\n\"personiﬁcation of the irrational\", the Joker represents \"everything\nBatman [opposes]\".[36] Other long time recurring foes that are part of\nBatman's rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar antiheroine\nwho is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al\nGhul, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy,\nHarley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc among others.\n\nAllies\n\nBatman surrounded by some of his\nenemies; art by Alex Ross\n\nAlfred\nBatman's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, ﬁrst appeared in Batman #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal\nfather ﬁgure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents'\ndeath and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only\nother resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character \"[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs\nand [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand\" to the hero and his sidekick.[98]\n\"Batman family\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n13/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe term \"Batman family\" is the informal name for a group of characters closely associated with Batman,\ngenerally costumed vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit\napproval. They include: Barbara Gordon, Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the\ncostumed identity of Batgirl and, during a period in which she was conﬁned to a wheelchair due to a gunshot\nwound inﬂicted by the Joker, the computer hacker Oracle; Helena Bertinelli, the sole surviving member of a\nmob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as the Huntress and as\nBatgirl for a brief stint; Cassandra Cain, the daughter of professional assassins David Cain, and Lady Shiva,\nwho succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.\nCivilians\nLucius Fox, a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's\nclandestine vigilante activities; Dr. Leslie Thompkins, a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate\nparental ﬁgure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; Vicki\nVale, an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the Gotham Gazette; Ace the BatHound, Batman's canine partner who was predominantly active in the 1950s and 1960s;[99] and Bat-Mite, an\nextra-dimensional imp predominately active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.[99]\nGCPD\nAs Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, Commissioner James \"Jim\" Gordon debuted along with Batman in\nDetective Comics #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-ﬁghting everyman, he shares\nthe Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of Watson does in Sherlock Holmes stories, a normal\nperson's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.\nJustice League\nBatman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders.\nBatman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the costars of World's Finest and Superman/Batman series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close\nfriends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an\nemphasis on their differing views on crime-ﬁghting and justice. In Superman/Batman #3 (December 2003),\nSuperman observes, \"Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from\nhis utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to\ncall on him.\"[100]\nRobin\nRobin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting\ncharacter for many years.[101] Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin\nbecause \"Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always\nhaving him thinking.\"[102] The ﬁrst Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in\n1940. In the 1970s he ﬁnally grew up, went off to college and became the hero\nNightwing. A second Robin, Jason Todd, appeared in the 1980s. In the stories\nhe was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker,\nbut was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the Red Hood, and\nbecame an antihero vigilante with no qualms about using ﬁrearms or deadly\nforce. Carrie Kelly, the ﬁrst female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the\nﬁnal Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels The Dark Knight\nReturns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, ﬁghting alongside an aging Batman\nin stories set out of the mainstream continuity.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\nBatman and Robin; art by\nJack Burnley.\n\n14/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe third Robin in mainstream comics is Tim Drake, who ﬁrst appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own\ncomic series, and currently goes by Red Robin, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the ﬁrst decade\nof the new millennium, Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made\ncostumed identity The Spoiler, and later as Batgirl.[103] After Stephanie Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed\nthe role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to Damian Wayne, the ten-year-old son of Bruce Wayne\nand Talia al Ghul, in the late 2000s.[104] Damian's tenure as du jour Robin ended when the character was killed\noff in the pages of Batman Incorporated in 2013.[105] Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise\nyoung woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the ornithological theme nonetheless; she debuted the\ncodename and identity of Bluebird in 2014. Unlike the Robins, Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun,\nalbeit non-lethal; her weapon of choice is a modiﬁed riﬂe that ﬁres taser rounds.[106] In 2015, a new series titled\nWe Are Robin will focus on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to ﬁght crime in Gotham City.\nWayne family\nHelena Wayne is the biological daughter of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle of an alternate universe established in\nthe early 1960s (Multiverse) where the Golden Age stories took place.\nDamian Wayne is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul,[63][107][108] and thus the grandson of\nBatman villain Ra's al Ghul.\nTerry McGinnis is the biological son of Bruce Wayne in the DC animated universe, and has taken over the roll\nas Batman when Bruce has become too elderly to do it.\n\nRomantic interests\nWriters have varied in the approach over the years to the \"playboy\" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. Some\nwriters show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others\nhave depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the beneﬁts of being \"Gotham's most eligible bachelor\".\nBruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically involved with many women throughout his various\nincarnations. The most signiﬁcant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle[109] and Talia al Ghul, as both\nwomen gave birth to his biological offsprings, Helena Wayne and Damian Wayne, respectively.\nSome of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as Julie\nMadison, Vicki Vale, and Silver St. Cloud. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies, such as\nBatwoman (Kathy Kane), Sasha Bordeaux, and Wonder Woman, and with villainesses, such as Catwoman,\nJezebel Jet, and Talia al Ghul.\nCatwoman\nWhile most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short, the attraction between Batman and Catwoman\nis present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Although Catwoman has been\nhistorically portrayed as a supervillain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common\ngoals and are usually depicted as having a romantic relationship.\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age\nstar the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries\nthe reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211). They have a daughter\nnamed Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin)\nGotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies\nuntil he is killed during one ﬁnal adventure as Batman.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n15/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nIn an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship, in which\nthe closing panel of the ﬁnal story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\".\nHowever, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline\nand, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Bruce Wayne and Selina\nKyle (out of costume) develop a relationship during The Long Halloween. The\nstory shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship\nends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman.\nIn Batman: Dark Victory, he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave\nhim for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an\nopera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called\n\"Hush\", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce\nand Selina. However, \"Hush\" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the\nentire rogues gallery and rekindling their romantic relationship. In \"'Hush\",\nBatman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.\nBatman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop in\nCatwoman #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have had an ongoing\nsexual relationship.[110]\n\nCatwoman is Batman's most\nenduring romance; art by\nAdam Hughes.\n\nFictional character biography\nBatman's history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. Few elements of the character's\nhistory have remained constant. Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s,\n\"Unlike some ﬁctional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a speciﬁc period, but has rather\nexisted in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than ﬁve decades.\"[111]\n\n20th century\nOrigin\nThe central ﬁxed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin\nstory.[80] As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horriﬁed and traumatized\nwhen he watched his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his\nwife Martha, murdered by a mugger with a gun. Batman refuses to\nutilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his\nparents. This event drove him to train his body to physical perfection\nand ﬁght crime in Gotham City as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also\nnoted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of\n\nBruce Wayne's family encounters Joe\nChill in Detective Comics #33 (Nov.\n1939); art by Bob Kane.\n\nRobin, \"Until recently, the ﬁxed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\",[80] a\nsituation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and\ncontinuity between stories.[112]\nGolden Age\nIn Batman's ﬁrst appearance in Detective Comics #27, he is already operating as a crime-ﬁghter.[113] Batman's\norigin is ﬁrst presented in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in Batman #47.\nAs these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and\ncharitable Gotham City socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged\nexistence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on\ntheir way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life ﬁghting crime.\nHe engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n16/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nbe enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike\nterror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat\nsuddenly ﬂies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.[114]\nIn early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne\nhas a ﬁancée named Julie Madison.[115] In Detective Comics #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat,\nDick Grayson, who becomes his junior counterpart, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the\nJustice Society of America,[116] although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,[117] and thus only\nparticipates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary\nmember of Gotham City's police department.[118] During this time, Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor,\nand after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.[119]\nSilver Age\nThe Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher\nintroduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of The Flash. Batman is not signiﬁcantly changed by the late\n1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One. The lighter tone Batman had taken in\nthe period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often\nfeature many science-ﬁction elements, and Batman is not signiﬁcantly updated in the manner of other characters\nuntil Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most scienceﬁction elements jettisoned from the series.\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age\nstar the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries\nthe reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211). They have a daughter,\nHelena Wayne, who as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's\nprotector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he\nis killed during one ﬁnal adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been\nmade between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman\ncomics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to\nstories from the Golden Age.[120] Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon\nthrough the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his\nuncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, January/February 1969) after his parents' death, and\nappearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.[121][122] In\n1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly\nchronicle Batman's origin and history.\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he\nbegan regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and\ncontinuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends.\nAs a founding member of the Justice League of America, Batman appears in its ﬁrst story, in 1960's Brave and\nthe Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up\nwith a different DC Universe superhero each month.\nBronze Age\nIn 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally,\nBatman also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation\nbuilding in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and\nearly 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures\nalso become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes,\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n17/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nincluding the ﬁrst appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the\narrival of Ra's al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson\nbecomes Nightwing.[7]\nIn the ﬁnal issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\nthe Outsiders. He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic\nsubsequently changed its title.\nDetective Comics #439 (1974) depicts Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School, in which the ﬁnal page\nshows a Yale Law School diploma hanging in Bruce Wayne's ofﬁce.[123]\nModern Age\nAfter the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Inﬁnite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major\ncharacters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in\nthe storyline \"Year One\" from Batman #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.[124] Though\nthe Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along\nwith an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining\nthe same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need\nfor Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred\nPennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although\nhe becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help ﬁll in the revised\nbackstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in\n1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the\n\"Year One\" period.\nSubsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-ﬁghting, a result of the\npain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when Tim Drake becomes the new\nRobin.[125]\nMany of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of\nissues. In 1993, DC published \"Knightfall\". During the storyline's ﬁrst phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes\nBatman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in\ntwo directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman\nonce more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a\nhealed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period,\nwhile Wayne trains for a return to the role.[126]\nThe 1994 company-wide crossover storyline \"Zero Hour\" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including\nthose of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now\nconsiders Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.\nBatman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the\nseries, titled JLA. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In\n1998's \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the\nUnited States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman ﬁghts to reclaim the city from legions\nof gangs during 1999's \"No Man's Land\".\nMeanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the\nevents of \"Batman: Ofﬁcer Down\" and \"Batman: War Games/War Crimes\"; Batman's long-time law\nenforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in\n\"Ofﬁcer Down\", while \"War Games\" and \"War Crimes\" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a\ncontingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a\nmassive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. Lex\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n18/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nLuthor arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid1990s) during the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs. Though Batman is able\nto clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the\norganization known as \"Checkmate\" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her\nemployer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his\nrevenge with help from Talia al Ghul in Superman/Batman #1–6.\n\n21st century\nDC Comics' 2005 limited series Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had altered Batman's\nmemories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr. Light after he sexually\nassaulted Sue Dibny. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and if\nnecessary, kill the other heroes. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's\ndeath becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the Inﬁnite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC\ncontinuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though at the very end\nBatman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking\nup a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces\nhim to not pull the trigger.\nFollowing Inﬁnite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake\nretrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\".[127] In the Face the\nFace storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is\ncaptured during Week 30 of the 52 series, which shows Batman ﬁghting his inner demons.[128] Later on in 52,\nBatman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat. This becomes an important part of\nthe regular Batman title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime ﬁghter while undergoing\nthis ritual, having \"hunted down and ate\" the last traces of fear in his mind.[129][130] At the end of the \"Face the\nFace\" story arc, Bruce ofﬁcially adopts Tim (who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character's\nhistory) as his son.[131] The follow-up story arc in Batman, Batman and Son, introduces Damian Wayne, who is\nBatman's son with Talia al Ghul. Although originally in Son of the Demon, Bruce's coupling with Talia was\nimplied to be consensual, this arc ret-conned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce.[132]\nBatman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of\nAmerica series,[133] and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders.[134]\nGrant Morrison's 2008 storyline, \"Batman R.I.P.\" featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the\nenigmatic villain Doctor Hurt and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which\nwould speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne.[135][136] However, though Batman is shown to possibly\nperish at the end of the arc, the two-issue arc \"Last Rites\", which leads into the crossover storylines \"Final\nCrisis\", shows that Batman survives his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave,\nonly to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate the New God Orion's death. The story\nends with Batman retrieving the god-killing bullet used to kill Orion, setting up its use in \"Final Crisis\".[137] In\nthe pages of Final Crisis Batman is reduced to a charred skeleton.[138] In Final Crisis #7 Wayne is shown\nwitnessing the passing of the ﬁrst man, Anthro.[139][140] Wayne's \"death\" sets up the three-issue Battle for the\nCowl miniseries in which Wayne's ex-proteges compete for the \"right\" to assume the role of Batman, which\nconcludes with Grayson becoming Batman,[141] while Tim Drake takes on the identity of Red Robin.[142] Dick\nand Damian continue as Batman and Robin, and in the crossover storyline \"Blackest Night\", what appears to be\nBruce's corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern zombie,[143] but is later shown that Bruce's corpse is one of\nDarkseid's failed Batman clones. Dick and Batman's other friends conclude that Bruce is alive.[144][145]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n19/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nBruce subsequently returns in Morrison's miniseries Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, which depicts his\ntravels through time from prehistory to present-day Gotham.[146][147][148] Bruce's return sets up Batman\nIncorporated, an ongoing series which focuses on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe,\nallowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham's Dynamic Duo. Bruce publicly announces that Wayne\nEnterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as \"Batman, Incorporated\". However, due to rebooted\ncontinuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, the New 52, Dick\nGrayson is restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also\ninterrupts the publication of Batman, Incorporated, which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit\nthe new status quo.\n\nCultural impact\nBatman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended\nbeyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 Batman ﬁlm and its accompanying\nmerchandising \"brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness\".[149] In an article commemorating\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the character, The Guardian wrote, \"Batman is a ﬁgure blurred by the endless\nreinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for\nthe 21st century.\"[150]\nIn addition, media outlets have often used the character in trivial and comprehensive surveys — Forbes\nmagazine estimated Bruce Wayne to be the 8th-richest ﬁctional character with his $6.9 billion fortune, several\nplaces after Iron Man, who is at 5.[151] BusinessWeek listed the character as one of the ten most intelligent\nsuperheroes appearing in American comics.[152] Entertainment Weekly named Batman as one of The 20 All\nTime Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture.[153] Batman was placed on AFI's 100 Years…100 Heroes and Villains\nfrom the 1989 feature ﬁlm by the American Film Institute.[154] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Batman's alter\nego Bruce Wayne as #46 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".[155] The character was the\nfocus of the 2008 non-ﬁction book Becoming Batman: The Possibility of a Superhero by E. Paul Zehr.\n\nIn other media\nThe character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic\nbooks, such as newspaper syndicated comic strips, books, radio dramas,\ntelevision, a stage show, and several theatrical feature ﬁlms. The ﬁrst adaptation\nof Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October\n25, 1943.[156] That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part serial\nBatman, with Lewis Wilson becoming the ﬁrst actor to portray Batman on\nscreen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made\noccasional guest appearances in The Adventures of Superman starting in 1945\non occasions when Superman voice actor Bud Collyer needed time off.[157] A\nsecond movie serial, Batman and Robin, followed in 1949, with Robert Lowery\ntaking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations\nduring the 1940s \"helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who\nnever bought a comic\n\nbook\".[157]\n\nIn the 1964 publication of Donald Barthelme's collection of short stories \"Come\nBack, Dr. Caligari\", Barthelme wrote \"The Joker's Greatest Triumph\". Batman\n\nAdam West as Batman\n(right) and Burt Ward as\nRobin in the 1960s Batman\nTV series\n\nis portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.[158]\nTelevision\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n20/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe Batman television series, starring Adam West, premiered in January 1966 on the ABC television network.\nInﬂected with a camp sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, Back to the\nBatcave, West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show\nwas instead a farce or lampoon, and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes; ending in 1968. In\nbetween the ﬁrst and second season of the Batman television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical ﬁlm\nBatman (1966). The Kinks performed the theme song from the Batman show on their 1967 album Live at\nKelvin Hall.\nThe popularity of the Batman TV series also resulted in the ﬁrst animated adaptation of Batman in The\nBatman/Superman Hour;[159] the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as The Adventures of Batman\nand Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From\n1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's Super Friends series; which was animated by HannaBarbera. Olan Soule was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during Super\nFriends by Adam West, who also voiced the character in Filmation's 1977 series The New Adventures of\nBatman.\nIn 1992, Batman: The Animated Series premiered on the Fox television\nnetwork; produced by Warner Bros. Animation and featuring Kevin Conroy as\nthe voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker\ntone, mature writing, stylistic design, and thematic complexity compared to\nprevious superhero cartoons,[160][161] in addition to multiple Emmy\nAwards.[162] The series' success led to the theatrical ﬁlm Batman: Mask of the\nBatman as depicted in the\naward-winning 1990s\nBatman: The Animated\nSeries\n\nPhantasm (1993),[163] as well as various spin-off TV series; including\nSuperman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Justice League\nand Justice League Unlimited (each of which also featured Conroy as Batman).\nThe futuristic series Batman Beyond also took place in this same animated\ncontinuity and featured a newer, younger Batman voiced by Will Friedle, with\nthe elderly Bruce Wayne (again voiced by Conroy) as a mentor.\n\nIn 2004, an unrelated animated series titled The Batman made its debut with Rino Romano as the title character.\nIn 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, featuring\nDiedrich Bader as Batman.\nIn 2013, a new CGI-animated series titled Beware the Batman made its debut, with Anthony Ruivivar voicing\nBatman.[164] In 2014, the live-action TV series Gotham premiered on the Fox network, featuring David Mazouz\nas a 12-year-old Bruce Wayne.\nTo commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television short ﬁlm, Batman:\nStrange Days, that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel.\nFilm\nIn 1989, Warner Bros. released the live-action feature ﬁlm Batman; directed by Tim Burton and starring\nMichael Keaton as the title character. The ﬁlm was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing ﬁlm of the\nyear, but at the time was the ﬁfth highest-grossing ﬁlm in history.[165] The ﬁlm also won the Academy Award\nfor Best Art Direction.[166] The ﬁlm's success spawned three sequels: Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever\n(1995) and Batman & Robin (1997); the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of\nBurton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney, respectively. The second\nSchumacher ﬁlm failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned; causing Warner Bros. to\ncancel the planned fourth sequel, Batman Unchained,[167] and end the initial ﬁlm series.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n21/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nIn 2005, Batman Begins was released by Warner Bros. as a reboot of the\nﬁlm series; directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale as\nBatman. Its sequel, The Dark Knight (2008), set the record for the highest\ngrossing opening weekend of all time in the U.S., earning approximately\n$158 million,[168] and became the fastest ﬁlm to reach the $400 million\nmark in the history of American cinema (eighteenth day of release).[169]\nThese record-breaking attendances saw The Dark Knight end its run as the\nsecond-highest domestic grossing ﬁlm (at the time) with $533 million,\nbested then only by Titanic.[170] The ﬁlm also won two Academy Awards,\nincluding Best Supporting Actor for the late Heath Ledger.[171] It was\neventually followed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which served as a\nconclusion to Nolan's ﬁlm series.\n\nMichael Keaton as Batman and\nJack Nicholson as the Joker in the\n1989 Batman ﬁlm\n\nSince 2008, Batman has also starred in various direct-to-video animated\nﬁlms under the DC Universe Animated Original Movies banner. Kevin\nConroy has reprised his voice role of Batman for several of these ﬁlms,\nwhile others have featured celebrity voice actors in the role; including\nJeremy Sisto, William Baldwin, Bruce Greenwood, Ben McKenzie, and\nPeter Weller.[172] A Lego-themed version of Batman was also featured as\none of the protagonists in the animated ﬁlm The Lego Movie (2014), with\nWill Arnett providing the voice.[173] Arnett will reprise the voice role in the\nupcoming 2017 ﬁlm The Lego Batman Movie.[174]\nIn 2016, Ben Afﬂeck began portraying Batman in the DC Extended\nUniverse with the release of the ﬁlm Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\ndirected by Zack\n\nSnyder.[175]\n\nAfﬂeck also made a cameo appearance as\n\nBatman in David Ayer's ﬁlm Suicide Squad (2016).[176] Afﬂeck will reprise\n\nPromotional poster of Ben Afﬂeck\nas Batman in the DC Extended\nUniverse\n\nthe role again in the upcoming 2017 ﬁlm Justice League[177] and will direct\nand star in an upcoming Batman ﬁlm,[178] also set in the DC Extended Universe.[179][180][181]\nVideo games\nSince 1986, Batman has starred in multiple video games, most of which were adaptations of the various\ncinematic or animated incarnations of the character. Among the most successful of these games is the Batman:\nArkham series. The ﬁrst installment, Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), was released by Rocksteady Studios to\ncritical acclaim; review aggregator Metacritic reports it as having received 92% positive reviews.[182] It was\nfollowed by the sequel Batman: Arkham City (2011), which also received widespread acclaim and holds a\nMetacritic ranking of 94%.[183] A prequel game titled Batman: Arkham Origins (2013) was later released by\nWB Games Montréal.[184] A fourth game titled Batman: Arkham Knight (2015) has also been released by\nRocksteady.[185] As with most animated Batman productions, Kevin Conroy has provided the voice of the\ncharacter for these games; excluding Arkham Origins, in which the younger Batman is voiced by Roger Craig\nSmith. In 2016, Telltale Games released Batman: The Telltale Series adventure game, which changed the\nWayne Family's history as it is depicted in the Batman mythos.[186]\n\nInterpretations\nGay interpretations\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n22/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nGay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric\nWertham asserted in Seduction of the Innocent in 1954 that \"Batman stories are psychologically homosexual ...\nThe Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be\nunconscious.\"[187] Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay \"Batman, Deviance, and Camp\" that Batman is\ninteresting to gay audiences because \"he was one of the ﬁrst ﬁctional characters to be attacked on the grounds of\nhis presumed homosexuality\".[188] Professor of ﬁlm and cultural studies Will Brooker argues the validity of a\nqueer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally ﬁnd themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted\nwithin, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identiﬁes a\nhomophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the\ncharacter.[189]\nCreators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, \"The\nBatman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay ... everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane ... none of them\nwrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view.\"[190] Frank Miller views\nthe character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimeﬁghting, concluding, \"He'd be much healthier if he were\ngay.\"[191] Grant Morrison said that \"Gayness is built into Batman ... Obviously as a ﬁctional character he's\nintended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it.\nAll these women fancy him and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get to him. He doesn't\ncare—he's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid.\"[192]\nIn 2000, DC refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to\nillustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s.[193] In\n2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in\nsuggestive and sexually explicit poses,[194] prompting DC to threaten legal action.[195]\nPsychological interpretations\nBatman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of\ninterpretations into the character's psyche.\nTravis Langley argues in Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight that the concept of archetypes as\ndescribed by psychologists Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell is seen in the Batman mythos, such that the\ncharacter represents the \"Shadow archetype\". This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own\ndark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from\nboth the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he\nchooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to ﬁght evil.\nLangley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our \"Shadow\nselves\".[196][197]\n\nNotes\n1.

The character\nwas created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill\n\nBatman\n\nFinger,[4][5] and ﬁrst appeared in Detective Comics #27\n(1939). Originally named the \"Bat-Man\", the character is\nalso referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader,\nthe Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.[6]\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American\nbillionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne\nEnterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents\nThomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore\nvengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a\nsense of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and\nintellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to ﬁght\ncrime.[7] Batman operates in the ﬁctional Gotham City,\nwith assistance from various supporting characters,\nincluding his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon,\nand vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most\nsuperheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers;\nrather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess,\nmartial arts abilities, detective skills, science and\ntechnology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable\nwill. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's\nrogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.\nBatman became popular soon after his introduction in\n1939 and gained his own comic book title, Batman, the\nfollowing year. As the decades went on, differing\ninterpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s\nBatman television series used a camp aesthetic, which\ncontinued to be associated with the character for years\nafter the show ended. Various creators worked to return\nthe character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with\nThe Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The success\nof Warner Bros.' live-action Batman feature ﬁlms have\nhelped maintain the public's interest in the character.[8]\nAn American cultural icon, Batman has been licensed\nand adapted into a variety of media, from radio to\ntelevision and ﬁlm, and appears on various merchandise\nsold all over the world, such as toys and video games.\nThe character has also intrigued psychiatrists, with many\ntrying to understand the character's psyche. In 2015,\nFanSided ranked Batman as number one on their list of\n\"50 Greatest Super Heroes In Comic Book History\".[9]\nKevin Conroy, Bruce Greenwood, Peter Weller, Anthony\nRuivivar, and Jason O'Mara, among others, have\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\nBatman in Detective Comics vol. 2, #1\n(November 2011); art by Tony Daniel\nPublication information\nPublisher\n\nDC Comics\n\nFirst appearance\n\nDetective Comics #27\n(coverdate May 1939/release date\nMarch 1939)\n\nCreated by\n\nBill Finger[1] (developer)\nBob Kane (concept)\nIn-story information\n\nAlter ego\n\nBruce Wayne\n\nTeam afﬁliations\n\nBatman Family\nJustice League\nOutsiders\nBatmen of All Nations\nBatman Incorporated\n\nPartnerships\n\nRobin (various)\nBatgirl (various)\nJames \"Jim\" Gordon\nSuperman\nWonder Woman\n\nNotable aliases\n\nMatches Malone[2]\n1/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nprovided the character's voice for animated adaptations.\nBatman has been portrayed in both ﬁlm and television by\nLewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael\nKeaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale,\nand Ben Afﬂeck.\n\nContents\n1 Publication history\n1.1 Creation\n1.2 Golden Age\n1.3 Silver and Bronze Age\n1.4 Modern Age\n2 Characterization\n2.1 Bruce Wayne\n2.2 Others\n3 Abilities\n3.1 Skills and training\n3.2 Technology\n4 Supporting characters\n4.1 Adversaries\n4.2 Allies\n4.3 Romantic interests\n5 Fictional character biography\n5.1 20th century\n5.2 21st century\n6 Cultural impact\n6.1 In other media\n6.2 Interpretations\n7 Notes\n8 References\n9 External links\n\nLefty Knox[3]\nAbilities\n\nGenius-level intellect\nPeak human physical and\nmental conditioning\nExpert martial artist and\nhand-to-hand combatant\nExpert detective\nUtilizes high-tech\nequipment and weapons\n\nPublication history\nCreation\nIn early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications (the\nfuture DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane created \"the Bat-Man\".[10]\nCollaborator Bill Finger recalled that \"Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see\nthe drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with\nkind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small domino mask, swinging\non a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ...\nBATMAN\".[11] The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's sketch of\nan ornithopter ﬂying device as a child.[12]\nFinger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and\ngloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume.[14][15][16][17] Finger said he\ndevised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: \"Bruce Wayne's ﬁrst name came from Robert\nBruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would\nsuggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.\"[18] He later said his\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\nsuggestions were inﬂuenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a\n\n2/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nsuggestions were inﬂuenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a\nsyndicated newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also\nfamiliar.[19]\nKane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for\ninspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods,\nand weaponry. Details ﬁnd predecessors in pulp ﬁction, comic strips,\nnewspaper headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane\nhimself.[20] As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had\nFirst image of Batman, in Action\npredecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel (created by Baroness Emmuska\nComics #12, announcing the\nOrczy, 1903) and Zorro (created by Johnston McCulley, 1919). Like\ncharacter's debut in the forthcoming\nthem, he performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by\nDetective Comics #27[13]\nplaying aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol.\nKane noted the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms The Mark of Zorro (1920) and The\nBat Whispers (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes\nlike Doc Savage, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes, made the character a master sleuth.[21][22]\nIn his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:\nOne day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some\ncrude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at.' He came over and I showed him the drawings.\nAt the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill\nsaid, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and\njust put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red\nunion suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good\ncombination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more\nominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we\nrealized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action, and changed them\ninto a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was ﬁghting or swinging down on a rope.\nAlso, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave ﬁngerprints.[19]\n\nGolden Age\nSubsequent creation credit\nKane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline\non all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say \"Batman created by Bob Kane\"; his name was simply\nwritten on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced\nby credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began\nreceiving a \"created by\" credit on the Superman titles, along with William Moulton Marston being given the\nbyline for creating Wonder Woman, Batman stories began saying \"Created by Bob Kane\" in addition to the\nother credits.\nFinger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he\nbegan, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of Batman\n#169 (February 1965) for example, editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler, one of\nBatman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline.\nKane wrote, \"Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not\nused his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.\"[18] At the time of Finger's death in\n1974, DC had not ofﬁcially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n3/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nJerry Robinson, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing\nto share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with The Comics\nJournal:\nBob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in\nany of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why ... [he was] going to leave\n[Kane's employ]. ... [Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there. ...\nThat was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital\nrole in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same\nco-creator credit in the strip, writer, and artist.[23]\nAlthough Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to\nfans that \"it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the\n''Batman, t' [sic] as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent\nand entirely untrue.\" Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. \"The trouble with being a 'ghost'\nwriter or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit',\nthen one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator.\"[24]\nIn 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview:\nIn those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of\nDC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never\nappear on the comic book in the ﬁnished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I\nnever volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.[25]\nIn September 2015, DC Entertainment revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman's\ncreation on the 2016 superhero ﬁlm Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the second season of Gotham\nafter a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC.[4] Finger received credit as a creator of Batman\nfor the ﬁrst time in a comic in October 2015 with Batman and Robin Eternal #3 and Batman: Arkham Knight\nGenesis #3. The updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as \"Batman created by Bob Kane with\nBill Finger\".[5]\nEarly years\nThe ﬁrst Batman story, \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\", was published in Detective Comics #27 (May\n1939). Finger said, \"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps\",[26] and this inﬂuence was evident\nwith Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he\nreceived his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in Detective Comics. By that time, Detective\nComics was the top-selling and most inﬂuential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other\nmajor hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.[27] The two characters were featured\nside-by-side as the stars of World's Finest Comics, which was originally titled World's Best Comics when it\ndebuted in fall 1940. Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this\nperiod.\nOver the course of the ﬁrst few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of\nBatman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and\nlengthened the ears on the costume. \"About a year later he was almost the full ﬁgure, my mature Batman\", Kane\nsaid.[28] Batman's characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939), followed by\nthe boomerang-like batarang and the ﬁrst bat-themed vehicle, the Batplane, in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\norigin was revealed in #33\n\n(Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story\n\n4/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\norigin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story\nthat establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by\nthe death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce\nWayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days\nlater, at their grave, the child vows that \"by the spirits of my parents [I\nwill] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all\ncriminals\".[29][30][31]\nThe early, pulp-inﬂected portrayal of Batman started to soften in\nDetective Comics #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of Robin,\nBatman's junior counterpart.[32] Robin was introduced, based on\nFinger's suggestion, because Batman needed a \"Watson\" with whom\nBatman could talk.[33] Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference\nfor a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of \"kid sidekicks\".[34]\nThe ﬁrst issue of the solo spin-off series Batman was notable not only\nfor introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the Joker and\nCatwoman, but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous\ngiants to death. That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree\nthat the character could no longer kill or use a gun.[35]\n\nBatman made his debut in Detective\nComics #27 (May 1939); cover art by\nBob Kane.\n\nBy 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the\nBatman mythos.[36] In the years following World War II, DC Comics \"adopted a postwar editorial direction that\nincreasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy\". The impact of this\neditorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period; removed from the \"bleak and menacing\nworld\" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal ﬁgure\nthat inhabited a \"bright and colorful\" environment.[37]\n\nSilver and Bronze Age\n1950s and early 1960s\nBatman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned\nduring the 1950s. In the story \"The Mightiest Team in the World\" in Superman #76 (June 1952), Batman teams\nup with Superman for the ﬁrst time and the pair discovers each other's secret identity.[38] Following the success\nof this story, World's Finest Comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of\nthe separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.[39] The team-up of the characters was\n\"a ﬁnancial success in an era when those were few and far between\";[40] this series of stories ran until the book's\ncancellation in 1986.\nBatman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the\npublication of psychologist Fredric Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent in 1954. Wertham's thesis was\nthat children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth.\nWertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin\nwere portrayed as lovers.[41] Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to\nthe establishment of the Comics Code Authority, a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The\ntendency towards a \"sunnier Batman\" in the postwar years intensiﬁed after the introduction of the Comics\nCode.[42] Scholars have suggested that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and the pre-Barbara Gordon BatGirl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories\ntook on a campier, lighter feel.[43]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n5/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nIn the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science ﬁction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the\nsuccess of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.[44] New characters such as Batwoman, Ace the\nBat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre\nspace aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in The Brave and the\nBold #28 (Feb. 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.\n\"New Look\" Batman and camp\nBy 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was \"planning to kill\nBatman off altogether\".[45] In response to this, editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles. He\npresided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), which was coverbilled as the \"New Look\". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to\nreturn him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the\ncharacter. The Batmobile was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modiﬁed to incorporate a yellow ellipse\nbehind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and\nBat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed)\nwhile a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick\nGrayson.[46]\nThe debut of the Batman television series in 1966 had a profound inﬂuence on the character. The success of the\nseries increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and Batman reached a circulation of close to 900,000\ncopies.[47] Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show's campy nature were introduced into the\ncomics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful\nfor a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the\nBatman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, \"When the television show\nwas a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books.\"[48]\nStarting in 1969, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from\nthe campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a \"grim avenger of the\nnight\".[49] O'Neil said his idea was \"simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read\nsome of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\"[50]\nO'Neil and Adams ﬁrst collaborated on the story \"The Secret of the Waiting Graves\" (Detective Comics #395,\nJanuary 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker Dick\nGiordano, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s;\nnevertheless the inﬂuence of their work was \"tremendous\".[51] Giordano said: \"We went back to a grimmer,\ndarker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well ...\"[52] While the work of O'Neil and Adams was\npopular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly\nacclaimed run by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Marshall Rogers in Detective Comics #471–476 (August\n1977 – April 1978), which went on to inﬂuence the 1989 movie Batman and be adapted for Batman: The\nAnimated Series, which debuted in 1992.[53] Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and\n1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.[54]\n\nModern Age\nThe Dark Knight Returns\nFrank Miller's limited series The Dark Knight Returns (February–June 1986) returned the character to his\ndarker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out\nof retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated the character. The Dark Knight Returns was a ﬁnancial success\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n6/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nand has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.[55] The series also sparked a major\nresurgence in the character's popularity.[56]\nThat year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of\nBatman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries Crisis on Inﬁnite Earths. O'Neil operated under the\nassumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books\nthan had gone before.[57] One outcome of this new approach was the \"Year One\" storyline in Batman #404–407\n(February–May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redeﬁned the character's origins.\nWriter Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page one-shot Batman:\nThe Killing Joke, in which the Joker, attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane, cripples Gordon's\ndaughter Barbara, and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.\nThe Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a 900 number for readers to call\nto vote on whether Jason Todd, the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a\nnarrow margin of 28 votes (see Batman: A Death in the Family).[58]\nKnightfall\nThe 1993 \"Knightfall\" story arc introduced a new villain, Bane, who critically injures Batman after pushing him\nto the limits of his endurance. Jean-Paul Valley, known as Azrael, is called upon to wear the Batsuit during\nBruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, and Alan Grant worked on the Batman\ntitles during \"Knightfall\", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's\n\"Cataclysm\" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's \"No Man's Land\", a year-long storyline that ran through\nall the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion\nof \"No Man's Land\", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck.\nAnother writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was Jeph Loeb. Along with longtime\ncollaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries (\"The Long Halloween\" and \"Dark Victory\") that pit an early\nin his career version of Batman against his entire rogues gallery (most notably Two-Face, whose origin was reenvisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman. In\n2003, Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to work on another mystery arc: \"Batman: Hush\" for the main Batman\nbook. The twelve–issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery,\nincluding an apparently resurrected Jason Todd, while seeking to ﬁnd the identity of the mysterious supervillain\nHush. While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. As the\nstoryline was Jim Lee's ﬁrst regular comic book work in nearly a decade, the series became #1 on the Diamond\nComic Distributors sales chart for the ﬁrst time since Batman #500 (October 1993) and Jason Todd's appearance\nlaid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick's subsequent run as writer on Batman, with another multi-issue\nepic, \"Under the Hood\", which ran from Batman #637–650.\nAll-Star Batman and Robin\nIn 2005, DC launched All-Star Batman and Robin, a stand-alone comic series set outside the existing DC\nUniverse. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC\nComics[59][60] though widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence.[61][62]\nStarting in 2006, Grant Morrison and Paul Dini were the regular writers of Batman and Detective Comics, with\nMorrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the\nscience ﬁction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations\nBatman suffered under the inﬂuence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training.\nMorrison's run climaxed with \"Batman R.I.P.\", which brought Batman up against the villainous \"Black Glove\"\norganization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. \"Batman R.I.P.\" segued into Final Crisis (also\nwritten by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid. In the 2009 miniseries\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n7/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nBatman: Battle for the Cowl, Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son\nDamian becomes the new Robin.[63][64] In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing Batman, while Grant\nMorrison was given his own series, titled Batman and Robin.[65]\nIn 2010, the storyline Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne saw Bruce travel through history, eventually\nreturning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue\nbeing Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his war on crime globally, which is the central focus of Batman\nIncorporated. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in Batman,\nDetective Comics, and Batman and Robin, while Wayne would be the main character in Batman Incorporated.\nAlso, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, Batman: The Dark Knight.\nThe New 52\nIn September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero books, including its Batman franchise, were canceled\nand relaunched with new #1 issues as part of the New 52 reboot. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be\nidentiﬁed as Batman and is featured in Batman, Detective Comics, Batman and Robin, and Batman: The Dark\nKnight. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many\ncharacters have their histories signiﬁcantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly\nintact. Batman Incorporated was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the \"Leviathan\" storyline.\nSince the beginning of the New 52, Scott Snyder has been the writer of the ﬂagship Batman title. His ﬁrst major\nstory arc was \"Night of the Owls\", where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a secret society that has\ncontrolled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was \"Death of the Family\", where the Joker returns to\nGotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was \"Batman: Zero\nYear\", which redeﬁned Batman's origin in The New 52. It followed Batman #0, published in June 2012, which\nexplored the character's early years. The ﬁnal storyline before the Convergence (2015) event was Endgame,\ndepicting the supposed ﬁnal battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus\nonto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.\nStarting with #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, mechaBatman, debuting in the Free Comic Book Day special comic Divergence. However, Bruce Wayne is soon\nrevealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his\nlife as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne ﬁnds happiness and proposes to his\ngirlfriend, Julie, but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to\ndestroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a \"strange star\" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne\ndiscovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that\nthis is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories\nas the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor.\nGordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shuttered.[66]\nIn 2015, DC Comics released The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, the sequel to Frank Miller's The Dark\nKnight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again.[67]\nDC Rebirth\nIn June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles. Batman was\nrebooted with a one-shot issue and began shipping twice-monthly, starting with Batman vol. 3, #1 (June 2016).\nThe series was written by Tom King, and artwork was provided by David Finch and Mikel Janín. The Batman\nseries introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl. Detective Comics resumed its original numbering\nsystem starting with June 2016's #934, and the New 52 volume 2 of the series was added into volume 1.[68]\nWriter James Tynion IV and artists Eddy Barrows and Alvaro Martinez worked on Detective Comics #934, and\nthe series initially featured a team consisting of Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, Cassandra Cain and Clayface, led\nby Batman and Batwoman.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n8/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nCharacterization\nBruce Wayne\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy\nAmerican industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the\nmurder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne,\nwhich ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and\nseek vengeance against criminals. He resides just outside of\nGotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor.\nWayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superﬁcial\nplayboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was\namassed through investment in real estate before the city\nbecame a bustling metropolis,[69] and the proﬁts of Wayne\n\nBruce Wayne in Batman vol. 2; art by Greg\nCapullo.\n\nEnterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[70] He supports\nphilanthropic causes through his nonproﬁt Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity\nsocialite.[71] In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid\ngossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most\nof his time.[72]\nWriters of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary\ndepending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison[73] notes that both heroes \"believe in the\nsame kind of things\" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast\nin their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: \"Bruce has a butler, Clark\nhas a boss.\" T. James Musler's book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce\nWayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his crusade against\ncrime.[74]\nModern stories tend to portray the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade[75] (in counterpoint\nto the post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the\nfacade).[76][77] In Batman Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology of the character,\nbehavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent\nhumanity; that \"Batman, for all its beneﬁts and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool\nfor Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better\".\nWill Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that \"the conﬁrmation of the Batman's identity lies with the\nyoung audience ... he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most\nimportantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ... and they're never\nwrong.\"[78]\nDuring the character's creation, the name \"Bruce Wayne\" was chosen for certain connotations. According to cocreator Bill Finger, \"Bruce Wayne's ﬁrst name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a\nplayboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ...\nthen I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.\"[79]\nPersonality\nBatman's primary character traits can be summarized as \"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and\nobsession\".[80] The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative\nteams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n9/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\n\"Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the\nBold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want\nto coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days.\"[81]\nThe driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill\nFinger discussed Batman's background and decided that \"there's nothing more traumatic than having your\nparents murdered before your eyes\".[82] Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a\nscientist[83][84] and to train his body into physical perfection[83][84] to ﬁght crime in Gotham City as Batman, an\ninspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.[83][84]\nAnother of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of\nhis parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by\ndifferent artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never\nvaried at all in the comic books, the \"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent\nexpressions\".[85] The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the\ncharacter's adventures.[80]\nBatman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as \"a\ndionysian ﬁgure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order\".[86] Dressed as a bat, Batman\ndeliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-ﬁghting,[87] a fear that originates from\nthe criminals' own guilty conscience.[88] Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into\nBatman's characterization,[89] such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and\nincreasingly alienated behavior. Batman's original character was changed in the 1950s when the now-defunct\ncomic book codes went into effect, and DC editor Whitney Ellsworth reinvented Batman as having a stringent\nmoral code which never allowed him to kill.[89] Miller's Batman was closer to the original, Golden Age version,\nwho was willing to kill criminals if necessary.[90]\n\nOthers\nOn two occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman. He served brieﬂy while Wayne recovered\nfrom spinal injuries caused by Bane in the 1993 Knightfall storyline. He assumed the mantle again in a 2009\ncomic book while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in\n2010. As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint\ncrossover event.\nIn an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin\nrepresented a \"reverse\" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, \"a more light-hearted and\nspontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin\". Morrison explained his intentions for the new\ncharacterization of Batman: \"Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's\npartner since he was a kid, he's led the Teen Titans, and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's\na very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; He's a lot looser and more relaxed.\"[63]\nOver the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to ofﬁcially take over for\nBruce during his leaves of absence. Jean Paul Valley, also known as Azrael, assumed the cowl after the events\nof the Knightfall saga. James Gordon, donned a mech-suit after the events of Batman: Endgame, and served as\nBatman in 2015 and 2016.\nAdditionally, members of the group Batman, Incorporated, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand\nof vigilantism, have at times stood in as the ofﬁcial Batman in cities around the world. Various others have also\ntaken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them,\nvarious former proteges of Bruce Wayne.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n10/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nAbilities\nSkills and training\nBatman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on \"his own scientiﬁc knowledge, detective skills, and\nathletic prowess\".[32] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a\nproﬁcient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is\nregarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver.[91] Batman has been\nrepeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC\nUniverse, and having peak human physical conditioning.[92] As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in\ncountless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe.[93] He has traveled the\nworld acquiring the skills needed to aid in his crusade against crime. In the Superman: Doomed story arc,\nSuperman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.[94]\nBatman has trained extensively in various martial arts, mastering over 127 different types, making him one of\nthe best hand-to-hand ﬁghters in the DC Universe. Superman describes Batman as \"the most dangerous man on\nEarth\", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his\nimprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's ﬁrst storyline in JLA.\nBatman has the ability to function under great physical pain and to withstand telepathy and mind control. He is\na master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering information under the identity of\nMatches Malone, a notorious gangster. He is a master of stealth and escapology, which allows him to appear\nand disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm.\nBatman is an expert in interrogation techniques and often uses extreme methods to extract information from\nsuspects, such as hanging a person over the edge of a building. His intimidating and frightening appearance\nalone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his\nenemies, Batman's most deﬁning characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a\nlife. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most\nnotably that of Superman and Wonder Woman.\nAmong physical and other crime ﬁghting related training, he is also proﬁcient at other types of skills. Some of\nthese include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the Batplane), as well as being able to operate other\ntypes of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.\n\nTechnology\nPersonal armor\nBatman's body armored costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.[95] The details\nof the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations,\nbut the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a\npair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane\noriginally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring\ncalled for black to be highlighted with blue.[95] Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark\nblue and grey;[95] as well as black and grey. In the Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns ﬁlms, Batman has\nbeen depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. Christopher\nNolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a\nblack bat in the middle. Ben Afﬂeck's Batman in the DC Extended Universe ﬁlms wears a suit more faithful to\nthe comic books versions, in which the suit is grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n11/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nBatman's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It\nprotects him from gunﬁre and other signiﬁcant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude\nfrom long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the\nscallops.[96] The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies\ngreatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, \"We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in\nthe Batcave so they don't have to look the same ... Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to\nput their own spin on it.\"[97]\nBatmobile\nBatman's primary vehicle is the Batmobile, which is usually depicted as\nan imposing black car, often with tailﬁns that suggest a bat's wings.\nBatman also has an aircraft called the Batplane (later called the\n\"Batwing\"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper\npractice, the \"bat\" preﬁx (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by\nBatman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some\nportrayals (primarily the 1960s Batman live-action television show and\nthe Super Friends animated series) stretched the practice to campy\nproportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a Batboat,\nBat-Sub, and Batcycle, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s\nThe 1966 television Batmobile, built\ntelevision series Batman has an arsenal that includes such \"bat-\" names\nby George Barris from a Lincoln\nas the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, batFutura concept car\ndrinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-ﬁlter, bat-shark\nrepellent bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline \"A Death in the Family\"\nsuggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the \"bat\" preﬁx on his own. In The\nDark Knight Returns, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name \"Batmobile\"\nwhen he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in\n2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier armor\nand new aesthetics.\nUtility belt\nBatman keeps most of his ﬁeld equipment in his utility belt. Over the years it has shown to contain an\nassortment of crime-ﬁghting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions\nof the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around\nit. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a\ncable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of\nGotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are guns, which he refuses to use on principle,\nsince a gun was used in his parents' murder.\nBat-Signal\nWhen Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens\ncalled the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be\nseen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.\nIn various incarnations, most notably the 1960s Batman TV series, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated\nphone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a\nwooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, Wayne\nManor, speciﬁcally both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone\nin the Batcave.\nBatcave\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n12/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion,\nWayne Manor. It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his\nvehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic\nBatman: Shadow of the Bat (issue #45) and the 2005 ﬁlm Batman Begins, the cave is said to have been part of\nthe Underground Railroad.\nOther equipment\nBatman uses a large arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs\nof which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept\nof Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939) and the ﬁrst\nbat-themed weapons the batarang and the \"Batgyro\" in Detective Comics #31 and #32 (September; October\n1939).[28]\n\nSupporting characters\nBatman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of\ncharacters.[80]\n\nAdversaries\nBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to\noutlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's\ncharacter and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead\nthem to a life of crime.[98] These foes are commonly referred to as\nBatman's \"rogues gallery\". Batman's \"most implacable foe\" is the Joker,\na homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is\nconsidered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the\nantithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a\nmaniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a\nserious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a\n\"personiﬁcation of the irrational\", the Joker represents \"everything\nBatman [opposes]\".[36] Other long time recurring foes that are part of\nBatman's rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar antiheroine\nwho is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al\nGhul, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy,\nHarley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc among others.\n\nAllies\n\nBatman surrounded by some of his\nenemies; art by Alex Ross\n\nAlfred\nBatman's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, ﬁrst appeared in Batman #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal\nfather ﬁgure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents'\ndeath and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only\nother resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character \"[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs\nand [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand\" to the hero and his sidekick.[98]\n\"Batman family\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n13/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe term \"Batman family\" is the informal name for a group of characters closely associated with Batman,\ngenerally costumed vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit\napproval. They include: Barbara Gordon, Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the\ncostumed identity of Batgirl and, during a period in which she was conﬁned to a wheelchair due to a gunshot\nwound inﬂicted by the Joker, the computer hacker Oracle; Helena Bertinelli, the sole surviving member of a\nmob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as the Huntress and as\nBatgirl for a brief stint; Cassandra Cain, the daughter of professional assassins David Cain, and Lady Shiva,\nwho succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.\nCivilians\nLucius Fox, a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's\nclandestine vigilante activities; Dr. Leslie Thompkins, a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate\nparental ﬁgure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; Vicki\nVale, an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the Gotham Gazette; Ace the BatHound, Batman's canine partner who was predominantly active in the 1950s and 1960s;[99] and Bat-Mite, an\nextra-dimensional imp predominately active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.[99]\nGCPD\nAs Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, Commissioner James \"Jim\" Gordon debuted along with Batman in\nDetective Comics #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-ﬁghting everyman, he shares\nthe Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of Watson does in Sherlock Holmes stories, a normal\nperson's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.\nJustice League\nBatman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders.\nBatman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the costars of World's Finest and Superman/Batman series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close\nfriends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an\nemphasis on their differing views on crime-ﬁghting and justice. In Superman/Batman #3 (December 2003),\nSuperman observes, \"Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from\nhis utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to\ncall on him.\"[100]\nRobin\nRobin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting\ncharacter for many years.[101] Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin\nbecause \"Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always\nhaving him thinking.\"[102] The ﬁrst Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in\n1940. In the 1970s he ﬁnally grew up, went off to college and became the hero\nNightwing. A second Robin, Jason Todd, appeared in the 1980s. In the stories\nhe was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker,\nbut was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the Red Hood, and\nbecame an antihero vigilante with no qualms about using ﬁrearms or deadly\nforce. Carrie Kelly, the ﬁrst female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the\nﬁnal Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels The Dark Knight\nReturns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, ﬁghting alongside an aging Batman\nin stories set out of the mainstream continuity.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\nBatman and Robin; art by\nJack Burnley.\n\n14/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe third Robin in mainstream comics is Tim Drake, who ﬁrst appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own\ncomic series, and currently goes by Red Robin, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the ﬁrst decade\nof the new millennium, Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made\ncostumed identity The Spoiler, and later as Batgirl.[103] After Stephanie Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed\nthe role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to Damian Wayne, the ten-year-old son of Bruce Wayne\nand Talia al Ghul, in the late 2000s.[104] Damian's tenure as du jour Robin ended when the character was killed\noff in the pages of Batman Incorporated in 2013.[105] Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise\nyoung woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the ornithological theme nonetheless; she debuted the\ncodename and identity of Bluebird in 2014. Unlike the Robins, Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun,\nalbeit non-lethal; her weapon of choice is a modiﬁed riﬂe that ﬁres taser rounds.[106] In 2015, a new series titled\nWe Are Robin will focus on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to ﬁght crime in Gotham City.\nWayne family\nHelena Wayne is the biological daughter of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle of an alternate universe established in\nthe early 1960s (Multiverse) where the Golden Age stories took place.\nDamian Wayne is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul,[63][107][108] and thus the grandson of\nBatman villain Ra's al Ghul.\nTerry McGinnis is the biological son of Bruce Wayne in the DC animated universe, and has taken over the roll\nas Batman when Bruce has become too elderly to do it.\n\nRomantic interests\nWriters have varied in the approach over the years to the \"playboy\" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. Some\nwriters show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others\nhave depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the beneﬁts of being \"Gotham's most eligible bachelor\".\nBruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically involved with many women throughout his various\nincarnations. The most signiﬁcant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle[109] and Talia al Ghul, as both\nwomen gave birth to his biological offsprings, Helena Wayne and Damian Wayne, respectively.\nSome of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as Julie\nMadison, Vicki Vale, and Silver St. Cloud. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies, such as\nBatwoman (Kathy Kane), Sasha Bordeaux, and Wonder Woman, and with villainesses, such as Catwoman,\nJezebel Jet, and Talia al Ghul.\nCatwoman\nWhile most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short, the attraction between Batman and Catwoman\nis present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Although Catwoman has been\nhistorically portrayed as a supervillain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common\ngoals and are usually depicted as having a romantic relationship.\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age\nstar the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries\nthe reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211). They have a daughter\nnamed Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin)\nGotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies\nuntil he is killed during one ﬁnal adventure as Batman.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n15/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nIn an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship, in which\nthe closing panel of the ﬁnal story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\".\nHowever, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline\nand, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Bruce Wayne and Selina\nKyle (out of costume) develop a relationship during The Long Halloween. The\nstory shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship\nends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman.\nIn Batman: Dark Victory, he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave\nhim for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an\nopera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called\n\"Hush\", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce\nand Selina. However, \"Hush\" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the\nentire rogues gallery and rekindling their romantic relationship. In \"'Hush\",\nBatman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.\nBatman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop in\nCatwoman #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have had an ongoing\nsexual relationship.[110]\n\nCatwoman is Batman's most\nenduring romance; art by\nAdam Hughes.\n\nFictional character biography\nBatman's history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. Few elements of the character's\nhistory have remained constant. Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s,\n\"Unlike some ﬁctional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a speciﬁc period, but has rather\nexisted in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than ﬁve decades.\"[111]\n\n20th century\nOrigin\nThe central ﬁxed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin\nstory.[80] As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horriﬁed and traumatized\nwhen he watched his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his\nwife Martha, murdered by a mugger with a gun. Batman refuses to\nutilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his\nparents. This event drove him to train his body to physical perfection\nand ﬁght crime in Gotham City as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also\nnoted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of\n\nBruce Wayne's family encounters Joe\nChill in Detective Comics #33 (Nov.\n1939); art by Bob Kane.\n\nRobin, \"Until recently, the ﬁxed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\",[80] a\nsituation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and\ncontinuity between stories.[112]\nGolden Age\nIn Batman's ﬁrst appearance in Detective Comics #27, he is already operating as a crime-ﬁghter.[113] Batman's\norigin is ﬁrst presented in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in Batman #47.\nAs these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and\ncharitable Gotham City socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged\nexistence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on\ntheir way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life ﬁghting crime.\nHe engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n16/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nbe enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike\nterror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat\nsuddenly ﬂies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.[114]\nIn early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne\nhas a ﬁancée named Julie Madison.[115] In Detective Comics #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat,\nDick Grayson, who becomes his junior counterpart, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the\nJustice Society of America,[116] although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,[117] and thus only\nparticipates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary\nmember of Gotham City's police department.[118] During this time, Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor,\nand after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.[119]\nSilver Age\nThe Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher\nintroduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of The Flash. Batman is not signiﬁcantly changed by the late\n1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One. The lighter tone Batman had taken in\nthe period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often\nfeature many science-ﬁction elements, and Batman is not signiﬁcantly updated in the manner of other characters\nuntil Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most scienceﬁction elements jettisoned from the series.\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age\nstar the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries\nthe reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211). They have a daughter,\nHelena Wayne, who as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's\nprotector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he\nis killed during one ﬁnal adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been\nmade between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman\ncomics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to\nstories from the Golden Age.[120] Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon\nthrough the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his\nuncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, January/February 1969) after his parents' death, and\nappearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.[121][122] In\n1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly\nchronicle Batman's origin and history.\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he\nbegan regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and\ncontinuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends.\nAs a founding member of the Justice League of America, Batman appears in its ﬁrst story, in 1960's Brave and\nthe Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up\nwith a different DC Universe superhero each month.\nBronze Age\nIn 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally,\nBatman also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation\nbuilding in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and\nearly 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures\nalso become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes,\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n17/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nincluding the ﬁrst appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the\narrival of Ra's al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson\nbecomes Nightwing.[7]\nIn the ﬁnal issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\nthe Outsiders. He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic\nsubsequently changed its title.\nDetective Comics #439 (1974) depicts Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School, in which the ﬁnal page\nshows a Yale Law School diploma hanging in Bruce Wayne's ofﬁce.[123]\nModern Age\nAfter the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Inﬁnite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major\ncharacters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in\nthe storyline \"Year One\" from Batman #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.[124] Though\nthe Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along\nwith an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining\nthe same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need\nfor Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred\nPennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although\nhe becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help ﬁll in the revised\nbackstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in\n1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the\n\"Year One\" period.\nSubsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-ﬁghting, a result of the\npain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when Tim Drake becomes the new\nRobin.[125]\nMany of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of\nissues. In 1993, DC published \"Knightfall\". During the storyline's ﬁrst phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes\nBatman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in\ntwo directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman\nonce more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a\nhealed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period,\nwhile Wayne trains for a return to the role.[126]\nThe 1994 company-wide crossover storyline \"Zero Hour\" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including\nthose of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now\nconsiders Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.\nBatman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the\nseries, titled JLA. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In\n1998's \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the\nUnited States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman ﬁghts to reclaim the city from legions\nof gangs during 1999's \"No Man's Land\".\nMeanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the\nevents of \"Batman: Ofﬁcer Down\" and \"Batman: War Games/War Crimes\"; Batman's long-time law\nenforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in\n\"Ofﬁcer Down\", while \"War Games\" and \"War Crimes\" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a\ncontingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a\nmassive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. Lex\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n18/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nLuthor arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid1990s) during the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs. Though Batman is able\nto clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the\norganization known as \"Checkmate\" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her\nemployer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his\nrevenge with help from Talia al Ghul in Superman/Batman #1–6.\n\n21st century\nDC Comics' 2005 limited series Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had altered Batman's\nmemories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr. Light after he sexually\nassaulted Sue Dibny. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and if\nnecessary, kill the other heroes. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's\ndeath becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the Inﬁnite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC\ncontinuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though at the very end\nBatman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking\nup a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces\nhim to not pull the trigger.\nFollowing Inﬁnite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake\nretrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\".[127] In the Face the\nFace storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is\ncaptured during Week 30 of the 52 series, which shows Batman ﬁghting his inner demons.[128] Later on in 52,\nBatman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat. This becomes an important part of\nthe regular Batman title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime ﬁghter while undergoing\nthis ritual, having \"hunted down and ate\" the last traces of fear in his mind.[129][130] At the end of the \"Face the\nFace\" story arc, Bruce ofﬁcially adopts Tim (who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character's\nhistory) as his son.[131] The follow-up story arc in Batman, Batman and Son, introduces Damian Wayne, who is\nBatman's son with Talia al Ghul. Although originally in Son of the Demon, Bruce's coupling with Talia was\nimplied to be consensual, this arc ret-conned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce.[132]\nBatman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of\nAmerica series,[133] and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders.[134]\nGrant Morrison's 2008 storyline, \"Batman R.I.P.\" featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the\nenigmatic villain Doctor Hurt and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which\nwould speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne.[135][136] However, though Batman is shown to possibly\nperish at the end of the arc, the two-issue arc \"Last Rites\", which leads into the crossover storylines \"Final\nCrisis\", shows that Batman survives his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave,\nonly to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate the New God Orion's death. The story\nends with Batman retrieving the god-killing bullet used to kill Orion, setting up its use in \"Final Crisis\".[137] In\nthe pages of Final Crisis Batman is reduced to a charred skeleton.[138] In Final Crisis #7 Wayne is shown\nwitnessing the passing of the ﬁrst man, Anthro.[139][140] Wayne's \"death\" sets up the three-issue Battle for the\nCowl miniseries in which Wayne's ex-proteges compete for the \"right\" to assume the role of Batman, which\nconcludes with Grayson becoming Batman,[141] while Tim Drake takes on the identity of Red Robin.[142] Dick\nand Damian continue as Batman and Robin, and in the crossover storyline \"Blackest Night\", what appears to be\nBruce's corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern zombie,[143] but is later shown that Bruce's corpse is one of\nDarkseid's failed Batman clones. Dick and Batman's other friends conclude that Bruce is alive.[144][145]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n19/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nBruce subsequently returns in Morrison's miniseries Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, which depicts his\ntravels through time from prehistory to present-day Gotham.[146][147][148] Bruce's return sets up Batman\nIncorporated, an ongoing series which focuses on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe,\nallowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham's Dynamic Duo. Bruce publicly announces that Wayne\nEnterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as \"Batman, Incorporated\". However, due to rebooted\ncontinuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, the New 52, Dick\nGrayson is restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also\ninterrupts the publication of Batman, Incorporated, which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit\nthe new status quo.\n\nCultural impact\nBatman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended\nbeyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 Batman ﬁlm and its accompanying\nmerchandising \"brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness\".[149] In an article commemorating\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the character, The Guardian wrote, \"Batman is a ﬁgure blurred by the endless\nreinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for\nthe 21st century.\"[150]\nIn addition, media outlets have often used the character in trivial and comprehensive surveys — Forbes\nmagazine estimated Bruce Wayne to be the 8th-richest ﬁctional character with his $6.9 billion fortune, several\nplaces after Iron Man, who is at 5.[151] BusinessWeek listed the character as one of the ten most intelligent\nsuperheroes appearing in American comics.[152] Entertainment Weekly named Batman as one of The 20 All\nTime Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture.[153] Batman was placed on AFI's 100 Years…100 Heroes and Villains\nfrom the 1989 feature ﬁlm by the American Film Institute.[154] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Batman's alter\nego Bruce Wayne as #46 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".[155] The character was the\nfocus of the 2008 non-ﬁction book Becoming Batman: The Possibility of a Superhero by E. Paul Zehr.\n\nIn other media\nThe character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic\nbooks, such as newspaper syndicated comic strips, books, radio dramas,\ntelevision, a stage show, and several theatrical feature ﬁlms. The ﬁrst adaptation\nof Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October\n25, 1943.[156] That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part serial\nBatman, with Lewis Wilson becoming the ﬁrst actor to portray Batman on\nscreen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made\noccasional guest appearances in The Adventures of Superman starting in 1945\non occasions when Superman voice actor Bud Collyer needed time off.[157] A\nsecond movie serial, Batman and Robin, followed in 1949, with Robert Lowery\ntaking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations\nduring the 1940s \"helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who\nnever bought a comic\n\nbook\".[157]\n\nIn the 1964 publication of Donald Barthelme's collection of short stories \"Come\nBack, Dr. Caligari\", Barthelme wrote \"The Joker's Greatest Triumph\". Batman\n\nAdam West as Batman\n(right) and Burt Ward as\nRobin in the 1960s Batman\nTV series\n\nis portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.[158]\nTelevision\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n20/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nThe Batman television series, starring Adam West, premiered in January 1966 on the ABC television network.\nInﬂected with a camp sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, Back to the\nBatcave, West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show\nwas instead a farce or lampoon, and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes; ending in 1968. In\nbetween the ﬁrst and second season of the Batman television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical ﬁlm\nBatman (1966). The Kinks performed the theme song from the Batman show on their 1967 album Live at\nKelvin Hall.\nThe popularity of the Batman TV series also resulted in the ﬁrst animated adaptation of Batman in The\nBatman/Superman Hour;[159] the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as The Adventures of Batman\nand Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From\n1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's Super Friends series; which was animated by HannaBarbera. Olan Soule was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during Super\nFriends by Adam West, who also voiced the character in Filmation's 1977 series The New Adventures of\nBatman.\nIn 1992, Batman: The Animated Series premiered on the Fox television\nnetwork; produced by Warner Bros. Animation and featuring Kevin Conroy as\nthe voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker\ntone, mature writing, stylistic design, and thematic complexity compared to\nprevious superhero cartoons,[160][161] in addition to multiple Emmy\nAwards.[162] The series' success led to the theatrical ﬁlm Batman: Mask of the\nBatman as depicted in the\naward-winning 1990s\nBatman: The Animated\nSeries\n\nPhantasm (1993),[163] as well as various spin-off TV series; including\nSuperman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Justice League\nand Justice League Unlimited (each of which also featured Conroy as Batman).\nThe futuristic series Batman Beyond also took place in this same animated\ncontinuity and featured a newer, younger Batman voiced by Will Friedle, with\nthe elderly Bruce Wayne (again voiced by Conroy) as a mentor.\n\nIn 2004, an unrelated animated series titled The Batman made its debut with Rino Romano as the title character.\nIn 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, featuring\nDiedrich Bader as Batman.\nIn 2013, a new CGI-animated series titled Beware the Batman made its debut, with Anthony Ruivivar voicing\nBatman.[164] In 2014, the live-action TV series Gotham premiered on the Fox network, featuring David Mazouz\nas a 12-year-old Bruce Wayne.\nTo commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television short ﬁlm, Batman:\nStrange Days, that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel.\nFilm\nIn 1989, Warner Bros. released the live-action feature ﬁlm Batman; directed by Tim Burton and starring\nMichael Keaton as the title character. The ﬁlm was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing ﬁlm of the\nyear, but at the time was the ﬁfth highest-grossing ﬁlm in history.[165] The ﬁlm also won the Academy Award\nfor Best Art Direction.[166] The ﬁlm's success spawned three sequels: Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever\n(1995) and Batman & Robin (1997); the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of\nBurton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney, respectively. The second\nSchumacher ﬁlm failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned; causing Warner Bros. to\ncancel the planned fourth sequel, Batman Unchained,[167] and end the initial ﬁlm series.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n21/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nIn 2005, Batman Begins was released by Warner Bros. as a reboot of the\nﬁlm series; directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale as\nBatman. Its sequel, The Dark Knight (2008), set the record for the highest\ngrossing opening weekend of all time in the U.S., earning approximately\n$158 million,[168] and became the fastest ﬁlm to reach the $400 million\nmark in the history of American cinema (eighteenth day of release).[169]\nThese record-breaking attendances saw The Dark Knight end its run as the\nsecond-highest domestic grossing ﬁlm (at the time) with $533 million,\nbested then only by Titanic.[170] The ﬁlm also won two Academy Awards,\nincluding Best Supporting Actor for the late Heath Ledger.[171] It was\neventually followed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which served as a\nconclusion to Nolan's ﬁlm series.\n\nMichael Keaton as Batman and\nJack Nicholson as the Joker in the\n1989 Batman ﬁlm\n\nSince 2008, Batman has also starred in various direct-to-video animated\nﬁlms under the DC Universe Animated Original Movies banner. Kevin\nConroy has reprised his voice role of Batman for several of these ﬁlms,\nwhile others have featured celebrity voice actors in the role; including\nJeremy Sisto, William Baldwin, Bruce Greenwood, Ben McKenzie, and\nPeter Weller.[172] A Lego-themed version of Batman was also featured as\none of the protagonists in the animated ﬁlm The Lego Movie (2014), with\nWill Arnett providing the voice.[173] Arnett will reprise the voice role in the\nupcoming 2017 ﬁlm The Lego Batman Movie.[174]\nIn 2016, Ben Afﬂeck began portraying Batman in the DC Extended\nUniverse with the release of the ﬁlm Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\ndirected by Zack\n\nSnyder.[175]\n\nAfﬂeck also made a cameo appearance as\n\nBatman in David Ayer's ﬁlm Suicide Squad (2016).[176] Afﬂeck will reprise\n\nPromotional poster of Ben Afﬂeck\nas Batman in the DC Extended\nUniverse\n\nthe role again in the upcoming 2017 ﬁlm Justice League[177] and will direct\nand star in an upcoming Batman ﬁlm,[178] also set in the DC Extended Universe.[179][180][181]\nVideo games\nSince 1986, Batman has starred in multiple video games, most of which were adaptations of the various\ncinematic or animated incarnations of the character. Among the most successful of these games is the Batman:\nArkham series. The ﬁrst installment, Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), was released by Rocksteady Studios to\ncritical acclaim; review aggregator Metacritic reports it as having received 92% positive reviews.[182] It was\nfollowed by the sequel Batman: Arkham City (2011), which also received widespread acclaim and holds a\nMetacritic ranking of 94%.[183] A prequel game titled Batman: Arkham Origins (2013) was later released by\nWB Games Montréal.[184] A fourth game titled Batman: Arkham Knight (2015) has also been released by\nRocksteady.[185] As with most animated Batman productions, Kevin Conroy has provided the voice of the\ncharacter for these games; excluding Arkham Origins, in which the younger Batman is voiced by Roger Craig\nSmith. In 2016, Telltale Games released Batman: The Telltale Series adventure game, which changed the\nWayne Family's history as it is depicted in the Batman mythos.[186]\n\nInterpretations\nGay interpretations\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman\n\n22/29\n\n\f5/1/2017\n\nBatman - Wikipedia\n\nGay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric\nWertham asserted in Seduction of the Innocent in 1954 that \"Batman stories are psychologically homosexual ...\nThe Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be\nunconscious.\"[187] Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay \"Batman, Deviance, and Camp\" that Batman is\ninteresting to gay audiences because \"he was one of the ﬁrst ﬁctional characters to be attacked on the grounds of\nhis presumed homosexuality\".[188] Professor of ﬁlm and cultural studies Will Brooker argues the validity of a\nqueer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally ﬁnd themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted\nwithin, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identiﬁes a\nhomophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the\ncharacter.[189]\nCreators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, \"The\nBatman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay ... everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane ... none of them\nwrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view.\"[190] Frank Miller views\nthe character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimeﬁghting, concluding, \"He'd be much healthier if he were\ngay.\"[191] Grant Morrison said that \"Gayness is built into Batman ... Obviously as a ﬁctional character he's\nintended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it.\nAll these women fancy him and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get to him. He doesn't\ncare—he's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid.\"[192]\nIn 2000, DC refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to\nillustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s.[193] In\n2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in\nsuggestive and sexually explicit poses,[194] prompting DC to threaten legal action.[195]\nPsychological interpretations\nBatman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of\ninterpretations into the character's psyche.\nTravis Langley argues in Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight that the concept of archetypes as\ndescribed by psychologists Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell is seen in the Batman mythos, such that the\ncharacter represents the \"Shadow archetype\". This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own\ndark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from\nboth the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he\nchooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to ﬁght evil.\nLangley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our \"Shadow\nselves\".[196][197]\n\nNotes\n1.
